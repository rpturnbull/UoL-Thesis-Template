\textit{This chapter aims to highlight the work completed in the duration of this thesis. Discussing the implications and the conclusion that have been drawn in previous chapters. Finally, presenting future work recommendations relevant to the project scope that would benefit the continuation of this work or as considerations in exoskeleton development.}

\section{Assessment of Research Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{\textit{Identify attachment point trends in the current exoskeleton design.}} The literature relevant to human-robot interaction (HRI) in assistive exoskeletons was collated and discussed in Chapter \ref{Ch:LitRev}, identifying trends and gaps in the exoskeleton literature. Building on this, a review of exoskeleton attachment was undertaken in Chapter \ref{Ch:Method}, identifying the need for a more thorough investigation of exoskeleton attachment. The finding in these two Chapters guided project direction.
	
	\item \textbf{\textit{Design methodology and system to identify objectively optimal attachment configurations for assistive exoskeleton on the human lower limb.}} In Chapter \ref{Ch:Method} a range of available methods for assessing HRI are discussed and considered. At the start of the project, a physical approach to testing was selected as it encompassed the natural response of soft tissue which is difficult to replicate in simulations at a whole-body scale.
	
	\item \textbf{\textit{Investigate and define sensors for use measuring human-exoskeleton interaction.}} During the literature review (Chapter \ref{Ch:LitRev}) a range of sensing technologies were identified and considered for their application in the assessment of the physical human-robot interface (pHRI). This work continued into Chapter \ref{Ch:Sense} where the space requirements were considered and force-sensitive resistors selected to be taken forward. These were selected due to their wide availability, low cost and slim form factor, enabling them to be placed within the interface with minimal impact on system design or user experience. The ability to be arranged into an array within the interfaces tight space constraints while being sensitive to the force ranges of interest (0-100N) made them a suitable choice to progress the investigation
	
	\item \textbf{\textit{Design and develop force sensing system located within physical human robot interface.}} Following sensor selection, the requirements for a system to assess pHRI forces was set out (Chapter \ref{Ch:Sense}). During the development, sensor characterisation was undertaken to identify the performance capabilities of sensors and, therefore, the system. Following sensor calibration and data acquisition control deployment, the system took its final form as a sleeve-based array. With a focus on flexibility, modularity and the assessment of multiple exoskeleton configurations and design setups.
	  
	\item \textbf{\textit{Design lower and upper limb modular exoskeletons.}} Following the identification of requirements and specifications (Chapter \ref{Ch:Design}). An iterative approach saw the development of a low-cost, modular exoskeleton. Fabricated primarily through rapid manufacturing techniques. To investigate the impact of changing lower limb exoskeleton  design, concepts of differing joint complexity were generated. The simpler form minimises design degree of freedom (DOF) based on common simplification seen in the literature. The complex version minimises simplification to the DOF, with 14 DOF selected for the lower limb. The purpose was to investigate how changing exoskeleton design impacts the user. An idea later explored for the lower limb through both preliminary testing (Chapter \ref{Ch:Prelim}) and simulation work (Chapter \ref{Ch:SimResults}). Designs were later transferred to simulation models with the move to alternate modes of assessment (Chapters \ref{Ch:SimDev}). Following the integration of soft design in the sensing sleeve, a novel alternate attachment method was produced combining soft and hard exoskeleton design. The attachment sleeve (Section \ref{sec:sleeve_attach}) was manufactured using an elasticated breathable fabric, supporting secure attachment and user comfort.
	
	\item \textbf{\textit{Conduct experimental work to objectively determine optimal lower limb attachment sites.}} Following the 6 and 14 DOFs lower limb exoskeletons manufacture, preliminary testing was undertaken to assess their performance. Testing was conducted with three subjects completing gait and activities of daily living such as sit to stand and stair ascent descent. A subgroup of 27 different configurations identified in the literature (Chapter \ref{Ch:Method}) was reduced to six key configurations. This was done due to time constraints and the time required to switch configurations. The prototype attachment sleeve was tested to identify how it performed compared to the more traditional cuff-based attachment during gait. The 6DOFLL and 14DOFLL systems were compared during gait to assess the impact of changing DOF.
	
	\item \textbf{\textit{Build and validate a model simulating human-robot interaction.}} The switch to a simulation-based approach saw the implementation of the design concepts set out in Chapter \ref{Ch:Design} into the in-silico environment (Chapter \ref{Ch:SimDev}). Following an investigation of simulation environments and interaction methods, SCONE was selected to generate the control sequences required to drive the musculoskeletal model. The high-fidelity dynamics physics engine (HyFyDy) was selected for its superior performance attributes, simple model format and effective handling of closed kinematic chains. An essential requirement in exoskeleton simulation research. HRI was modelled as a linear spring-damper system based on joints typically used within models. Models for the 6 and 14 DOFs lower limb exoskeletons were produced, though due to musculoskeletal model limitations, the 14 DOF system was tested on a planar system. Linear interaction model coefficients were validated against force data from five test subjects, using the sensing sleeve system developed in this project, achieving a 70\% accuracy level.
	
	\item \textbf{\textit{Use model to identify optimal lower limb attachment sites.}} Following simulation validation, testing was undertaken for all 64 possible combinations of the attachment points. These were assessed based on interaction forces, joint alignment, metabolic output, joint load, muscle activation and gait analysis. The configurations were ranked against each metric to provide a score with a possible total of 32 points split between the different attributes. Based on these scores, recommendations for favourable attachment were made. A comparison between the physical preliminary data (Chapter \ref{Ch:Prelim}), configurations identified in the literature (Chapter \ref{Ch:Method}) and the simulation results will be discussed further in Section \ref{Sec:ChNDisc}. 
	
%	\item \textbf{\textit{Develop a new non-linear interaction model for the assessment of HRI.}} With the successful implementation and validation of a linear interaction model, a non-linear model was developed. Making the model more representative of the physical interaction observed. The model is set out in Section \ref{Sec:Ch7NonLinModel} and is the start of a process by which more accurate soft tissue modelling can be implemented in optimisation controlled musculoskeletal simulation.
	
%	\item \textbf{\textit{Conduct simulation analysis to assess system efficiency dependent on attachment locations.}}
\end{enumerate}


\section{Discussion} \label{Sec:ChNDisc}
Based on the review of attachment locations within the literature (Chapter \ref{Ch:Method}) 26 configurations were identified as being of interest (Chapter \ref{Ch:Prelim}). This was either due to their frequent use in studies or based on the soft tissue distribution and its potential influences (Table \ref{table:Ch6AttachmentConfigurations}). Exoskeleton removal, configuration change, and re-attachment prior to commencing tasks were time-consuming. Therefore, the 27 identified configurations were reduced to six during preliminary testing (Chapter \ref{Ch:Prelim}). The two configurations sets (6 and 27) were compared to the simulation results to assess how logic-based selection compares to the in-silico model. 

%preliminary results
During preliminary testing, the six configurations selected were chosen due to their use in academic literature and soft tissue distributions. Within the literature, few studies \cite{Gordan2018BayesianOpto} have looked to assess attachment point location with none looking at the overall picture of the lower limb. One of the critical disadvantages of perusing physical testing is the infeasibility of assessing the entire population, in this case, configuration, due to the time requirement and necessity of test subjects. Because of this, the selection of the six configurations taken forward during preliminary testing was based on the extreme case of all attachments; minimal soft tissue configurations; and the configurations most commonly seen in the literature. These exclude testing of any configurations that could be deemed less applicable, with 58 configurations going untested. The perusal of a physical testing based approach was to negate the negative factors associated with the modelling-based approach. Namely, the simplifications to the soft tissue structures within the pHRI and the modelling of their interaction with external forces. The detailed modelling of soft tissue has been limited to finite element analysis with its deployment to exoskeleton research requiring an understanding of both robotics and biomedical fields. The whole-body response in key however, implementing FEA across the whole-body could prove computationally expensive. 

Regarding configuration selection the preliminary testing did not produce conclusive results. This was due to the small configuration sample size making 9\% of possible 64 configurations. Although it was hypothesised that having a single attachment point for a given limb segment would generate larger torque around that point. Resulting force increases were not observed. Configuration selection was made with expectation that there would be a significant difference between responses. The reality was that force response was nuanced, therefore the limited sample size meant concrete conclusions could not be drawn on specific attachment configurations. The preliminary work therefore highlighted the need for an expanded sample range. A key finding of the preliminary work on configurations was the need to investigate a range of activities with significantly different results observed between the sit-to-stand compared to the step-up motion. 

Although rarely justified in the literature, attachment configuration trends were identified (Chapter \ref{Ch:Method}). These were based on power transmission, minimising interaction cuffs and improving link stability. Conditions with zero attachment points and all attachment points were added to provide the extremes even though these were rarely observed within the literature. A zero attachment would be representative of an end effector-based system. With all attachment points, the model is more closely representative of soft exoskeleton systems, although the loading modalities differ significantly. Interestingly in-silico configuration 64 (all) came $5^{th}$/64 even though the approach was rarely used within the literature. This suggests that the novel hybrid soft-hard sleeve attachment methodology proposed in this work has potential.

During preliminary work the 6DOFLL, 14DOFLL and sleeve based 6DOFLL were compared during gait. Where cuff-based attachment was implemented in the 6DOFLL and 14DOFLL prototypes all attachment points were used matching configuration 64 (6 DOFs) in-silico model. During testing the sleeve implementation produced the lowest pHRI force increase compared to without the exoskeleton (4.5N) when compared to the 6DOFLL (8N) and 14DOFLL (7N).  Given that the DOFLL exoskeleton was used for the sleeve an $\approx$56\%) decrease in normal force was achieved. The cause of this is thought to be the 6DOFLL kinematically constrained structure. This was confirmed by the subtle change observed with the 14DOFLL (1N). The impact of system kinematics was later confirmed in Chapter \ref{Ch:SimResults} where the addition of a single DOF between the exoskeleton and pelvis anchor point resulted in reduction in joint load and normal interaction forces. It was however clear that the additional DOF reduced system stability with pHRI force increases observed on the right side. Combined with the preliminary results these highlight the need to explore higher DOF systems to understand the implications on human-exoskeleton interaction.

Based on the model developed during this research, it is suggested that proximal shank attachment is beneficial to overall lower limb exoskeleton performance under passive settings. The thigh however has greater flexibility in attachment deployment with a paired cuff placement shown to be beneficial. 

Similar to the configuration selected for investigation during preliminary work, the 27 configurations had a 60:40 split between the top and bottom 50\%. Those that were in the bottom 50\% were at the upper end (Figure \ref{table:6DOFLinScoreSummary}). The number of literature based configurations with poor rankings highlights the need for more research in this area. The zero attachment configuration scored poorly ($53^{rd}$), likely due to the exoskeletons free movement making gait more difficult. With the addition of actuation reassessing this end effector based setup will be of interest. The two configurations selected for their tissue distribution ranked $15^{th}$ and $50^{th}$.

As an investigation into human-robot interaction pertaining to exoskeleton attachment, this thesis set out to highlight its importance as a fundamental building block of exoskeleton design. With impacts seen from user comfort to system efficiency. This work sets out the need for the continued assessment of attachment design. Further work is required to assess exoskeleton attachment under a range of conditions, including a range of motions and ADLs; the integration of actuation, its control and the effects of power transfer on system efficiency; to the development of soft tissue models including tissue distribution, dynamic stiffnesses and the analysis of pathological gait. The interaction of human and robot are a fundamental part of the exoskeleton function, and it is hoped that this thesis helped stress its importance while contributing to the body of knowledge.


\section{Conclusions}
% Ch 5 exoskeleton design
\subsection{Physical system design and investigation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Following a review of current exoskeleton design it was identified that more work is required to clarify how best to facilitate human-exoskeleton interaction. 
	\item The design of a modular, low-cost testing platform was presented, supporting the future investigation of a wide range of exoskeleton based research. With a view to reduce system impedance a range of exoskeletons were proposed. The kinematic constraints caused by the over simplification of exoskeleton joints can lead to increased interaction forces during gait. Increasing joint complexity (DOF) was demonstrated to reduce interaction forces.
	\item With the goal of reducing system impedance a novel hybrid soft-hard exoskeleton attachment system provides a promising novel approach to user-exoskeleton integration. Attachment sleeve proof of concept testing successfully demonstrated the methods ability to reduce the interface force response compared to equivalent cuff based methods. With further development the approach could lead to a more seamless experience for exoskeleton users. 
	\item The force tracking system developed highlighted the production of a soft sensing array that could be implemented between exoskeleton and user. Enabling the ability to test multiple attachment methodologies and configurations with the same system.
	\item In the investigation of human-exoskeleton interaction a range of loading conditions must be assessed with activities produced significantly different response using the same system. These motions should be dynamic motions to incorporating a wide range of motion to explore movement extremes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{In-silico model development}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Optimisation-based musculoskeletal biomechanics simulation (SCONE and HyFyDy physics engine) were applied to the assistive exoskeleton research field. This work highlights it as a powerful tool for investigating HRI and broader exoskeleton research through its powerful solving of closed kinematic chains. 
	\item Using a constant contact approach, linear interaction models investigating normal and shear forces at the physical interface were deployed. The model was validated against test subjects and achieved an error of 30\% with output values closely matching those seen by other physical testing within the academic literature.
%	within this environment and then setting out a framework and development of non-linear model in the HyFyDy environment. 
	\item The shank attachment contributed significantly to overall lower limb exoskeleton stability. Configurations with a higher number of attachment locations achieved superior performance scores.
	\item Thigh attachment did not provide a significant effect dependent on overall exoskeleton performance. Therefore, attachment selection can be based on situation-specific inputs. It was observed that larger normal forces in the thigh resulted a greater shank shear response. Further work is required to determine how this is affected by DOF increases.
	\item Although hypothesised that knee misalignment would induce greater joint load, a weak correlation between the two was found ($R^{2}$ = 0.150).
	\item The model highlighted the effect of additional DOF with substantial changes in shank normal and shear forces with the addition of a DOF between the pelvis and exoskeleton anchor point. The addition was made to replicate to represent trunk fixation. Further work is needed to explore the full effect of DOF expansion.
\end{itemize}



\section{Future Work}
This research has provided insight into the assessment of HRI with the goal of improving system design. This section sets out recommendations for future work, which would aid the continued development of designs and models set out in this research.

\subsection{Exoskeleton Design}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{\textit{Actuation - }} As described by Pons et al. \cite{Pons2008} a system must be comfortable and able to reproduce the full user ROM prior to the addition of actuation and control methods. In this research, an adjustable modular exoskeleton test platform was produced. With the ability to easily swap out components, work should be undertaken to integrate actuation and spring-based passive joints. Following the inclusion of actuation within the system, further testing should be completed to identify the implications for HRI, with comparisons made to the findings of this research.
	
	\item \textbf{\textit{Tracking shear forces at the interface - }} Currently, in sensor design, compact devices capable of measuring shear forces are still in the development stages. As the technology reaches maturity, it should be included in systems being used to track pHRI during exoskeleton development and as feedback during use. Shear forces are of particular importance with long-term exoskeleton use. Enabling the system to pre-emptively reduce the chance of pressure ulcer formation.
	
	\item \textbf{\textit{Joint alignment - }} The exoskeleton joint designs set out in this research have been developed to provide two cases of alignment: Best case and worst case. While the worst-case has been defined by reproducing a minimal number of DOF, the best case is based on current literature ideas and the author's design decisions. Further work using the model produced would need to be undertaken to investigate how best to ensure alignment between natural and mechanical joints. Simulation packages such as SCONE will be key to this investigation with joint centre localisation in 3D space more accessible than with physical motion capture. This is an important area to the future of exoskeleton design with implications on natural joint health for long term users.
	
	\item \textbf{\textit{Sleeve attachment design development - }} Bringing together hard and soft exoskeletons, the sleeve attachment methodology is a promising novel way of securing the connection between user and exoskeleton. While the concept was explored, further work investigating its integration into everyday clothing will help create a seamless experience for exoskeleton users. Users of assistive exoskeletons can clip in and out of the system with relative ease. The development of the sleeve attachment methodology would be of particular interest in the upper limb, where the possible attachment area is limited relative to the lower limb.
	
	\item \textbf{\textit{Joint Torque - }} The interaction in the current design revolves around the human body applying load to the exoskeleton. A proposed idea is the inclusion of torque units at joints altering the resistance. The units are commonly used in orthotics such as the Ultra safe step ankle [Ultraflex, Dirame Ortho NV/SA, Belgium] to correct gait dysfunction, aiding the user to achieve a more natural gait pattern. Integrating such a torque unit would allow for the investigation of HRI where the user has to work against the exoskeleton.
	
	\item \textbf{\textit{Self Supporting - }} Prior to actuator integration, adjustments to make the exoskeleton support its own weight should be made. Doing so alters the load applied to the user, the required work against system impedance, and enables the deployment of passive assistance to minimise user energy expenditure.
	
	\item \textbf{\textit{Mechanical Stops - }} With actuation implementation the natural ROM data (collated in Table \ref{table:body_nat_dof}) can be used to design mechanical safety stops. Which alongside control-based safety measure ensures the chosen actuation methods cannot cause harm to the user.
	
	
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Simulation Model Development}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{\textit{Addition of assistance -}} Following the integration of passive spring-based joint motors enabling the exoskeleton model to be self-supporting. The addition of assistance should be investigated within the simulation environment. Requiring the development of an integrated control system it lay outside the scope of this project. However, the implications for attachment placement and impact on HRI are important to exoskeleton design.  
	
	\item \textbf{\textit{Simulated movement -}} Having demonstrated the SCONE HRI model during gait, further work should be undertaken to investigate other motions such as activities of daily living as these will provide insights on HRI in a different environment. This would require the development of motion specific musculoskeletal control algorithms, which would need validation against real-world data once such an algorithm has been developed, the benefits to the research community spread further than the primary assistive exoskeleton research. Data can be compared to movement databases such as the one compiled by Camargo et al. \cite{Camargo2021}.
	%Using extensive databases like
	%http://www.epic.gatech.edu/opensource-biomechanics-camargo-et-al/
	
 	\item \textbf{\textit{Soft tissue model - }} As has been identified during this research, soft tissue modelling in musculoskeletal simulation is currently one of the key limitations. Continued work should be undertaken to progress the interaction model from a linear to non-linear response. Development of a non-linear model was considered however fell outside the current projects time constraints. The development of such a model has scope for more accurate investigation of human-exoskeleton interaction. With its integration a study comparing it to the linear 6DOFLL model presented above could quantify the improvements. Further work should set out to produce a robust and versatile soft tissue model that is further validated against real-world observations, including tissue sampling.
 	
 	\item \textbf{\textit{Model Complexity - }} The implementation of an additional pelvis DOF was shown to impact response areas such as knee alignment, highlighting the need to investigate the effect of increasing DOF on HRI. Implementing the fourteen DOFs exoskeleton model proposed will provide some insight. However, with the deployment of a three-dimensional version of H0918M, currently in development, the finding stand to be more relevant.
	
	\item \textbf{\textit{Energy absorption -}} In its current form the tissue model only looks at interaction, with further development of the soft tissue model it may be possible to investigate how the soft tissue absorbs energy. Yandell et al. \cite{yandell2017dynamics} found that up to 55\% of energy is absorbed by soft tissue with up to 75\% then released by the elastic response. This creates a 9\% inefficiency based on soft tissue alone. Therefore, modelling this energy absorption into soft tissue means exoskeleton power transmission efficiency can be studied in-silico, enabling improvement to exoskeleton design. The ability to study power transmission, will lead to greater synergy with which comes reduced system impedance and improved user comfort and safety.
	
	\item \textbf{\textit{Variable sizes -}} While this research has outlined the development of a model for the investigation of HRI, there are still variables that need to be identified. The model remained a consistent size for all configurations assessed. Work should be undertaken to scale the model to different population percentiles to determine user height and weight impact on interaction. A variety of models sizes enables the fine-tuning of control strategies ensuring safety across the populace.
	
	\item \textbf{\textit{Upper limb simulation -}} Following the completion of work on the lower limb, musculoskeletal control strategies need to be implemented for the upper limb over a range of ADLs. With the upper limbs greater dexterity, it is expected that identifying favourable attachment configurations would require more movements than the lower limb.
	
	\item \textbf{\textit{User pathology - }} The model produced here does not consider asymmetry in user motion. Such as stroke patients where one side may require greater support. Future development of this HRI assessment method could create a model based on pathologic gait, enabling the assessment of asymmetric augmentation and the associated control.
	
	\item \textbf{\textit{Exoskeleton weight - }} Although exoskeleton weight changes were decoupled from results. Work should be undertaken to investigate what point exoskeleton weight becomes a significant factor regarding pHRI. The lightweight system set out in this thesis will increase in weight with increasing complexity such as with the implementation of actuators and meeting weight bearing requirements.
\end{enumerate}
