@article{Geyer2010,
abstract = {While neuroscientists identify increasingly complex neural circuits that control animal and human gait, biomechanists find that locomotion requires little control if principles of legged mechanics are heeded that shape and exploit the dynamics of legged systems. Here, we show that muscle reflexes could be vital to link these two observations. We develop a model of human locomotion that is controlled by muscle reflexes which encode principles of legged mechanics. Equipped with this reflex control, we find this model to stabilize into a walking gait from its dynamic interplay with the ground, reproduce human walking dynamics and leg kinematics, tolerate ground disturbances, and adapt to slopes without parameter interventions. In addition, we find this model to predict some individual muscle activation patterns known from walking experiments. The results suggest not only that the interplay between mechanics and motor control is essential to human locomotion, but also that human motor output could for some muscles be dominated by neural circuits that encode principles of legged mechanics. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

@article{Lenzi2011b,
abstract = {This paper presents a novel, distributed approach to monitor physical interaction between a user and a wearable robot. We propose to apply a matrix of optoelectronic sensors embedded in a thin and compliant silicone bulk onto the user-robot contact surface. This distributed tactile sensor can measure the pressure distribution on the interaction area without affecting the comfort of the user, and does not require the robot to be specifically designed to house it. Besides the estimation of the interaction force/torque, the distributed approach allows to monitor the pressure on the user's skin. This information is fundamental to assess the comfort and safety of the users which determine the final acceptability of the robot-mediated rehabilitation. The proposed method is preliminary evaluated on an elbow active orthosis during a repetitive rehabilitation task. Experimental results prove the relevance of this approach for the detection of the user motion intention through a measurement of the interaction force distribution.},

abstract = {This study aimed to assess the physiological consequences of using an upper limb exoskeleton during manual handling task, as muscle activity, upper limb kinematics, postural balance and cardiac cost. Participants performed three tasks (load lifting (LIFT), carrying (WALK) and stacking-unstacking (STACK)) with (EXOS) and without (FREE) an exoskeleton. During LIFT and STACK, the activity of the deltoid anterior muscle was significantly lower for EXOS than for FREE. During LIFT, the activity of the triceps brachii (TB) and tibialis anterior muscles significantly increased for EXO. The TB muscle activity significantly decreased for EXOS during WALK. The cardiac cost tended to increase with the use of the exoskeleton during LIFT, compared to FREE. The upper limb kinematics significantly differed between the EXOS and FREE conditions for all tasks. The benefits of the upper limb exoskeleton to reduce shoulder flexor muscle activity has been demonstrated, while broader physiological consequences have also been evidenced as increased antagonist muscle activity, postural strains, cardiovascular demand, and modified kinematics.},

@article{Yousaf2021,
abstract = {Physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) interfaces are responsible for ensuring safe, comfortable, and effective force transfer between wearable devices and their users. However, analysis is often oversimplified by treating the human-robot attachment as a rigid connection and using gross load measurements. As a result, information about the distribution of forces across the human-robot contact surface is lost. In this paper, we present an analysis method to predict distributed loading across a pHRI interface based on a model with discretized elastic elements that account for compliance from human soft tissue and the robot attachment. Stiffness properties of a proxy upper arm are measured with an indenter and used in the pHRI interface model. The analysis is performed assuming a rigid arm model, consistent with the underlying assumption in literature, and repeated using the proposed compliant arm model with measured elastic properties. The distributed loading predicted by the pHRI interface model is validated with measurements from a sensorized upper arm cuff on the Harmony exoskeleton. Our results reveal that a model incorporating compliance at the human-robot attachment is necessary to improve prediction of distributed interface loads. This motivates the need for human-centered analysis which can enable finer control of interaction forces and help design more ergonomic attachment interfaces.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. This paper deals with the evaluation of an exoskeleton designed for assisting individuals to rehabilitate compromised lower limb movements resulting from stroke or incomplete spinal cord injury. The exoskeleton is composed of lightweight tubular structures and six free joints that provide a modular feature to the system. This feature allows the exoskeleton to be adapted to assist the movement of one or more patient joints. The actuation of the exoskeleton is also modular, and can be performed passively, by means of springs and dampers, or actively through actuators. In addition, its telescopic tubular links, developed to adjust the size of the links in order to align the joints of the exoskeleton with patient joints, allows the exoskeleton to be adjustable to fit different patients. Experiments considering the interaction between a healthy subject and the exoskeleton are performed to evaluate the influence of the exoskeleton structure on kinematic and muscular activity profiles during walking.},

There is currently no agreement regarding changes in the MTU due to aging and injury. Currently, the application of SSI for the purpose of diagnosis, rehabilitation, and physical training remains limited by a number of issues, including the lack of normative value ranges, the lack of consensus regarding the appropriate terminology, and an inadequate understanding of the main technical limitations of this novel technology.},

abstract = {One of the major problems in the project of an exoskeleton is the design of adequate attachments or fixations between the human body and the robotic device. In this work it has been proposed, analyzed and tested a new design for a compliant exoskeleton fixation based on metallic strips. These strips behave as a rigid interface in the sagittal plane of the arm and act as compliant interfaces to compensate for misalignments between the exoskeleton and the human limb. The design concept has been modelled and analyzed mathematically and then included in an exoskeleton prototype for the upper arm with three degrees of freedom. The load tests have provided a range of feasible values for the strips. These values have been used to build the attachments of an upper limb exoskeleton with three actuated degrees of freedom. The system is ready for tests with humans to determine the actual force transfer between the human and the exoskeleton during typical arm movements and if this system improves user comfort. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {Multichannel electromyography (EMG) signals are one of the common methods used in human motion pattern recognition. In exoskeleton robot control, EMG signals are measured during dynamic or isometric muscle contractions. Various types of contraction can cause EMG signals to vary, affecting recognition performance. A motion pattern recognition model using EMG signals from either dynamic or isometric muscle contractions has not yet been fully investigated. In this study, a novel feature extraction method, using the short-time Fourier transform ranking (STFT-ranking) feature, was employed to determine multichannel EMG signals. The performance of the novel feature and conventional features for motion pattern recognition using EMG signals, which included time-domain and frequency-domain features, was compared during dynamic and isometric muscle contractions. Experiments were conducted using an exoskeleton robotic arm to aid users in generating EMG signals of designated motion patterns. Among the features tested, the STFT-ranking feature yielded an accuracy rate exceeding 90{\%} when the EMG signals used in the training and validation feature data sets were of the same type of muscle contraction. After examining the STFT-ranking feature projected onto the PCA space, the STFT-ranking feature was determined to offer more satisfactory performance than the other features tested for motion pattern recognition, because the feature data it collected from various motion patterns were more separable. The experimental results also revealed that it is preferable that EMG signals from the same type of muscle contraction, whether dynamic or isometric, are consistently used in both the training and validation (control) phases. Inconsistent EMG signals in the training and validation phases yielded a negative effect on motion pattern recognition performance. The methodology developed in this study has potential applications in exoskeleton robot control and rehabilitation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Various attempts have been initiated for different clinical application goals, such as diagnosis of pathological posture and movements, assessment of pre- and post-treatment efficacy and comparison of different treatment protocols. Image-based methods for measurements of human posture and movements have been developed, such as the photogrammetry, optoelectric technique and video analysis. However, it is found that these methods are complicated to set up, time-consuming to operate and could only be applied in laboratory environments. Electronic sensors and systems with advanced technology, namely accelerometer, gyroscope, flexible angular sensor, electromagnetic tracking system and sensing fabrics, have been developed and applied to solve the relevant application problems of the image-based methods. Nonetheless, other problems for using these electronic sensors emerged, including the environment influence and signal extraction difficulties. Further development of these electronic sensors and measurement methods could enhance their clinical applications in institutional as well as community levels. This article reviews the possible applications of these electronic sensors and systems, and precautions of their applications in analysis of human posture and movement. Such information would help researchers and clinicians in selecting and developing the most appropriate measurement techniques of using the electronic sensors for clinical applications of human posture and movement analysis.},

abstract = {Control and overall system performance of an upper limb exoskeleton, as a wearable robot, is dictated in part by the human machine interface and the implemented control algorithm. The ultimate goal is to develop algorithms so the operator feels as if the exoskeleton is a natural extension the body. The aim of the current research is to compare the system performance of a 7 degree of freedom wearable upper limb exoskeleton (EXO-UL7) using two multi-sensor admittance controllers (1) task space control and (2) joint space control. Multiple force sensors are needed due to the redundancy in the system (7 DOF). This redundancy is explored and a method is developed to calculate a closed form inverse kinematics (IK) solution. The IK solution is used to develop the task space controller. The joint space controller uses the transpose of the jacobian to resolve sensor forces into joint torques. Six subjects performed a peg in hole task. Six targets covered the main part of the device workspace. Velocities and Interaction forces at the upper arm, lower arm, handle and tip were recorded during the experiments. Power exchange between the subject and device was calculated. Task space based control was about 11{\%} lower in mean interaction energy for the peg in hole task compared to joint space control. Task completion time increased with both controllers compared to back-driving the device.},

abstract = {To the paralyzed or those otherwise enable to move on their own we have been developing a "muscle suit" providing muscular support as a wearable robot. Muscle suits are worn and use a McKibben artificial muscle driven by compressed air. Because actuators are sewn into a garment, no metal frame is needed, making a muscle suit very light and cheap. Most medical and welfare apparatuses were developed for caregivers rather than patients in need of nursing, causing patients to lose their own identity and a positive attitude. With the muscle suit they could control their movement by their own will. The muscle suit is very helpful for both muscular and mental support. Thus, since it is applicable directly to human as a wearable robot, it is based on a concept different from conventional robot technology.},

abstract = {Since the first edition of this book was published in 2004, to much acclaim, the pace of innovation in the field of skin metrology has increased and various new technologies have become available. This new, revised edition reflects these advances by presenting the current theory and practice of noninvasive investigation and measurement of the skin and its appendices in health and disease. The first, extensive part of this authoritative work is devoted to the physiology and metrology of the various structural components of the skin. Skin functions and their measurement are then discussed in detail, with sections on mechanical protection, photoprotection, barrier function, immune function, thermoregulation, and sensory function. In addition, careful consideration is given to skin disease rating and skin maps, and a unique list of physical and biological constants and units is provided. Not only is this new edition the first comprehensive, practical handbook in this domain - it will also serve as a manual of skin physiology and collates anatomical, functional, and physical quantitative data that would otherwise be arduous to retrieve because of their dispersal throughout the literature. It will prove a valuable resource for dermatologists, cosmetologists, bioengineers, physiologists, pharmacists, and all others who deal with the skin in their work.},

Following these efforts, 53 ICU patients developed pressure ulcers in the sacral area in fiscal year 2009, representing a 12.5{\%} incidence for the ICU as compared to a 3.4{\%} overall pressure ulcer incidence for the total hospital. In order to achieve additional reduction in pressure ulcer incidence, we replicated an initiative that called for application of a silicone foam dressing every 3 days to determine its effect on sacral pressure ulcer incidence in the ICU. We found that the use of the dressing further diminished the incidence of sacral pressure ulcers in our patients.},

In this work, the evaluation of human motion intention (HMI) based on electroencephalogram (EEG) and surface electromyography (sEMG) signals are analyzed for a knee exoskeleton control as a preliminary study for gait neuro-rehabilitation with a hybrid robotic system. This system consists of the knee exoskeleton H2 and the UFES's Smart Walker, which are used to restore the neuromotor control function of subjects with neural injuries. An experimental protocol was developed to identify patterns to control the exoskeleton in accordance with the HMI-based on EEG/sEMG. The EEG and sEMG signals are recorded during the following activities: stand-up/sit-down and knee flexion/extension. HMI is analyzed through both event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) and slow cortical potential, as well as the myoelectric pattern classification related to lower limb. The feature extraction from sEMG signals is based on vector combinations in time and frequency domain which are used for a pattern classification stage trough an artificial neural network with Levenberg Marquadt training algorithm and support vector machine. Preliminary results shown that a combination of EEG/sEMG signals can be used to define a control strategy for the robotic system.},

abstract = {Background: The internal joint contact forces experienced at the lower limb have been frequently studied in activities of daily living and rehabilitation activities. In contrast, the forces experienced during more dynamic activities are not well understood, and those studies that do exist suggest very high degrees of joint loading. Methods: In this study a biomechanical model of the right lower limb was used to calculate the internal joint forces experienced by the lower limb during vertical jumping, landing and push jerking (an explosive exercise derived from the sport of Olympic weightlifting), with a particular emphasis on the forces experienced by the knee. Findings: The knee experienced mean peak loadings of 2.4-4.6 × body weight at the patellofemoral joint, 6.9-9.0 × body weight at the tibiofemoral joint, 0.3-1.4 × body weight anterior tibial shear and 1.0-3.1 × body weight posterior tibial shear. The hip experienced a mean peak loading of 5.5-8.4 × body weight and the ankle 8.9-10.0 × body weight. Interpretation: The magnitudes of the total (resultant) joint contact forces at the patellofemoral joint, tibiofemoral joint and hip are greater than those reported in activities of daily living and less dynamic rehabilitation exercises. The information in this study is of importance for medical professionals, coaches and biomedical researchers in improving the understanding of acute and chronic injuries, understanding the performance of prosthetic implants and materials, evaluating the appropriateness of jumping and weightlifting for patient populations and informing the training programmes of healthy populations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Accurate human movement estimation techniques are widely used in various applications, such as robotics, human-machine interaction, sports, and rehabilitation. With rapid advances in microsensors, human movement estimation using wearable micro inertial sensors has become an active research topic. The main challenges for the wearable sensor motion estimation are the inertial sensor drift problem and the linear acceleration interference problem. Because of the agility in movement, upper limb motion estimation has been regarded as the most difficult problem in human motion estimation. In this paper, we take the upper limb as our research subject and present a novel upper limb movement estimation algorithm to cope with these two challenges by adaptive fusion of sensor data and human skeleton constraint. In the sensor fusion part, a quaternion-based unscented Kalman filter is invoked to fuse the gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer measurement information. In the Kalman filter framework, an acceleration interference detection scheme is implemented based on the exponentially discounted average of the normalized innovation squared (NIS). According to the detection results, the process and measurement noise levels are scaled up or down automatically. To further compensate for the drift, we present a novel solution by modeling geometrical constraint in the elbow joint and fuse the constraint to revise the sensor fusion results and improve the estimation accuracy. The experimental results have shown that the proposed algorithm can provide accurate results in comparison to the BTS SMART-D optical motion tracker.},

abstract = {This study investigated the effects on metabolic cost and gait biomechanics of using a prototype lower-body exoskeleton (EXO) to carry loads. Nine US Army participants walked at 1.34 m/s on a 0{\%} grade for 8 min carrying military loads of 20 kg, 40 kg and 55 kg with and without the EXO. Mean oxygen consumption (VO(2)) scaled to body mass and scaled to total mass were significantly higher, by 60{\%} and 41{\%} respectively, when the EXO was worn, compared with the control condition. Mean VO(2) and mean VO(2) scaled to body mass significantly increased with load. The kinematic and kinetic data revealed significant differences between EXO and control conditions, such as walking with a more flexed posture and braking with higher ground reaction force at heel strike when wearing the EXO. Study findings demonstrate that the EXO increased users' metabolic cost while carrying various loads and altered their gait biomechanics compared with conventional load carriage. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE: An EXO designed to assist in load bearing was found to raise energy expenditure substantially when tested by soldiers carrying military loads. EXO weight, weight distribution and design elements that altered users' walking biomechanics contributed to the high energy cost. To realise the potential of EXOs, focus on the user must accompany engineering advances.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Human locomotion has been modeled as a force-driven harmonic oscillator (FDHO). The minimum forcing function in locomotion has been shown to occur at the resonant frequency of the FDHO and results in the suggestion that oxygen cost may be considered an optimality criterion for locomotion. The purposes of this study were twofold: first, to determine the relationship between stride frequency and shock attenuation, and second, to determine whether shock attenuation may also be considered an optimality criterion. Ten healthy young adult males served as subjects in this study. Each subject's preferred running speed and preferred stride frequency (PSF) were determined. In addition to the PSF, they ran at stride frequencies corresponding to -20{\%}, -10{\%}, +10{\%}, and +20{\%} of the PSF at the preferred running speed. Metabolic data as well as leg and head acceleration data were collected during a steady state run at each of the stride frequency conditions. The metabolic data produced a U-shaped curve hypothesized by the FDHO model. Spectral analysis on the leg and head acceleration data were used to develop transfer functions for each of the stride frequency conditions. Analysis of the transfer function indicated that there was a gain at the low frequencies and an attenuation at the higher frequencies. The transfer function at the higher frequencies indicated that the impact shock signal was attenuated as it passed through the body. However, the transfer functions appeared to vary according to the amount of shock input to the system with the result that the head accelerations remained constant. It would appear that impact (high frequency) shock attenuation increases with stride frequency and thus does not fit the FDHO model as an optimization criterion. At all stride frequencies, regardless of the impact shock, head accelerations were maintained at a constant level. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Introduction: Hip protectors represent a promising strategy for preventing fall-related hip fractures. However, clinical trials have yielded conflicting results due, in part, to lack of agreement on techniques for measuring and optimizing the biomechanical performance of hip protectors as a prerequisite to clinical trials. Methods: In November 2007, the International Hip Protector Research Group met in Copenhagen to address barriers to the clinical effectiveness of hip protectors. This paper represents an evidence-based consensus statement from the group on recommended methods for evaluating the biomechanical performance of hip protectors. Results and conclusions: The primary outcome of testing should be the percent reduction (compared with the unpadded condition) in peak value of the axial compressive force applied to the femoral neck during a simulated fall on the greater trochanter. To provide reasonable results, the test system should accurately simulate the pelvic anatomy, and the impact velocity (3.4 m/s), pelvic stiffness (acceptable range: 39-55 kN/m), and effective mass of the body (acceptable range: 22-33 kg) during impact. Given the current lack of clear evidence regarding the clinical efficacy of specific hip protectors, the primary value of biomechanical testing at present is to compare the protective value of different products, as opposed to rejecting or accepting specific devices for market use. {\textcopyright} 2009 International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.},

abstract = {Changes in the mechanical properties of dermis occur during skin aging or tissue remodeling and affect the activity of resident fibroblasts. With the aim to establish elastic culture substrates that reproduce the variable softness of dermis, we determined Young's elastic modulus E of human dermis at the cell perception level using atomic force microscopy. The E of dermis ranged from 0.1 to 10 kPa, varied depending on body area and dermal layer, and tended to increase with age in 26-55-year-old donors. The activation state of human dermal fibroblasts cultured on "skin-soft" E (5 kPa) silicone culture substrates was compared with stiff plastic culture (GPa), collagen gel cultures (0.1-9 kPa), and fresh human dermal tissue. Fibroblasts cultured on skin-soft silicones displayed low mRNA levels of fibrosis-associated genes and increased expression of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) MMP-1 and MMP-3 as compared with collagen gel and plastic cultures. The activation profile exhibited by fibroblasts on "skin-soft" silicone culture substrates was most comparable with that of human dermis than any other tested culture condition. Hence, providing biomimetic mechanical conditions generates fibroblasts that are more suitable to investigate physiologically relevant cell processes than fibroblasts spontaneously activated by stiff conventional culture surfaces. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Society for Investigative Dermatology.},

abstract = {Wearable robots should be designed not to alter human physiological motion. Perturbations introduced by a robot can be quantified by measuring EMG activity. This paper presents tests on the LENAR, an intrinsically back-drivable non-anthropomorphic lower limb wearable robot designed to provide hip and knee flexion/extension assistance. In previous works the robot was demonstrated to exhibit low mechanical impedance and to introduce minor alterations to human kinematic patterns during walking. In this paper muscular activity is assessed, demonstrating small alterations in the EMG patterns during the interaction with the robot, in both unpowered and assistive mode.},

Firstly, by using polynomial expression approximation design, dynamics system with arbitrary attractor in controller can have the self-oscillation characteristic. Secondly, by using online update design, dynamics system can have synchronization characteristic for in-out signal.

abstract = {In this paper we present a design methodology for a bicondylar joint that mimics many of the physical mechanisms in the human knee. We replicate the elastic ligaments and sliding and rolling joint surfaces. As a result the centre of rotation and moment arm from the quadriceps changes as a function of flexion angle in a similar way to the human knee. This leads to a larger moment arm in the centre of motion, where it is most needed for high load tasks, and a smaller moment arm at the extremes, reducing the required actuator displacement. This is anticipated to improve performance:weight ratio in legged devices for tasks such as stair accent and sit-to-stand. In the design process ligament attachment positions, femur profile and ligament lengths were taken from cadaver studies. This information was then used as inputs to a simplified kinematic computer model in order to design a valid profile for a tibial condyle. A physical model was then tested on a custom built squatting robot. It was found that although ligament lengths deviated from the designed values the robot moment arm still matched the model to within 6.1{\%} on average. This shows that the simplified model is an effective design tool for this type of joint. It is anticipated that this design, when employed in walking robots, prostheses or exoskeletons, will improve the high load task capability of these devices. In this paper we have outlined and validated a design method to begin to achieve this goal.},

Due to the lacking of a prominent analysis of this topic that can acquaint concomitant communities of the research avant-garde, there are still vital perspectives that, if pleaded, would create a vital turn in the way of interaction among people and mobile devices. In this paper, we have presented a comprehensive survey along with the prevailing state of various challenges of human activity recognition based on wearable, environmental, and smartphone sensors. Firstly, we have shown numerous factors to be considered for the data pre-processing part regarding noise filtering and segmentation methods. Besides, we have made a list of sensing devices, sensors, and applications that can be used for collecting activity data along with a discussion on sensor position and requirements. Moreover, we have made a comprehensive analysis of some benchmark datasets, which includes information about sensors, attributes, activity classes, etc. Finally, we have shown an analysis of activity recognition approaches on some of the benchmark datasets based on existing works.},

abstract = {Humanoid robots are designed and built to mimic human form and movement. Ultimately, they are meant to resemble the size and physical abilities of a human in order to function in human-oriented environments and to work autonomously but to pose no physical threat to humans. Here, a humanoid robot that resembles a human in appearance and movement is built using powerful actuators paired with gear trains, joint mechanisms, and motor drivers that are all encased in a package no larger than that of the human physique. In this paper, we propose the construction of a humanoid-applicable anthropomorphic 7-DoF arm complete with an 8-DoF hand. The novel mechanical design of this humanoid arm makes it sufficiently compact to be compatible with currently available narrating-model humanoids, and to be sufficiently powerful and flexible to be functional; the number of degrees of freedom endowed in this robotic arm is sufficient for executing a wide range of tasks, including dexterous hand movements. The developed humanoid arm and hand are capable of sensing and interpreting incoming external force using the motor in each joint current without conventional torque sensors. The humanoid arm adopts an algorithm to avoid obstacles and the dexterous hand is capable of grasping objects. The developed robotic arm is suitable for use in an interactive humanoid robot.},

The target application is pedestrian navigation system (PNS), but these algorithms are general for other applications too involving autonomous systems. A MEMS IMU is mounted on the foot of the agent in order to get benefit of known walking patterns of the wearer. Algorithms are derived based on motion constraints of human walking and applied to reduce the inherent error drift in inertial navigation systems (INS). Experiments are conducted in indoor/outdoor unstructured environment to validate this algorithmic approach and shown that without using any other sensors and any other pre-conditions on the environment; we can reduce navigation errors significantly only by taking into account the motion constraints of human walking.},

Exo-Glove Poly was developed to use two motors, one for the thumb and the other for the index/middle finger, and an under-actuation mechanism to grasp various objects. In order to realize Exo-Glove Poly, design features and fabrication processes were developed to permit adjustment to different hand sizes, to protect users from injury, to enable ventilation, and to embed Teflon tubes for the wire paths. The mechanical properties of Exo-Glove Poly were verified with a healthy subject through a wrap grasp experiment using a mat-type pressure sensor and an under-actuation performance experiment with a specialized test set-up. Finally, performance of the Exo-Glove Poly for grasping various shapes of object was verified, including objects needing under-actuation.},

By taken the advantage of coupling linkage mechanism, each finger with three phalanges could fulfill flexion and extension independently. Besides, each finger is equipped with torque and position sensors. Thus, the cosmetics and dexterity are improved remarkably compared to commercial prosthesis. The hardware architecture is hierarchically organized as control system and human-machine interaction system. To evaluate the performances of the hand, the pattern reorganization experiment based on support vector machine (SVM) was conducted. The results show that FSR sensing technology is suitable for muscle activity detection; Compared to nearest neighborhood classifier, SVM method improves the predict success rate. Moreover, it also demonstrates that the hand is dexterous and manipulates like human.},

abstract = {The hope was recently expressed (Hill I937, p. 116) that with the development of a more accurate and rapid technique for muscle heat measurement, a much more consistent picture might emerge of the energy relations of muscles shortening (or lengthening) and doing positive (or negative) work. This hope has been realized, and some astonishingly simple and accurate relations have been found, relations, moreover, which (among other things) determine the effect of load on speed of shortening, allow the form of the isometric contraction to be predicted, and are the basis of the so-called "visco-elasticity" of skeletal muscle. This paper is divided into three parts. In Part I further developments of the technique are described: everything has depended on the technique, so no apology is needed for a rather full description of it and of the precautions necessary. In Part II the results themselves are described and discussed. In Part III the "visco-elastic" properties of active muscle are shown to be a con- sequence of the properties described in Part II.},

abstract = {Engineering design must be carefully planned and systematically executed. In particular, engineering design methods must integrate the many different aspects of designing and the priorities of the end-user. Engineering Design (3rd edition) describes a systematic approach to engineering design. The authors argue that such an approach, applied flexibly and adapted to a particular task, is essential for successful product development. The design process is first broken down into phases and then into distinct steps, each with its own working methods. The third edition of this internationally-recognised text is enhanced with new perspectives and the latest thinking. These include extended treatment of product planning; new sections on organisation structures, simultaneous engineering, leadership and team behaviour; and updated chapters on quality methods and estimating costs. New examples have been added and existing ones extended, with additions on design to minimise wear, design for recycling, mechanical connections, mechatronics, and adaptronics. Engineering Design (3rd edition) is translated and edited from the sixth German edition by Ken Wallace, Professor of Engineering Design at the University of Cambridge, and Luci{\"{e}}nne Blessing, Professor of Engineering Design and Methodology at the Technical University of Berlin. Topics covered include: Fundamentals; product planning and product development; task clarification and conceptual design; embodiment design rules, principles and guidelines; mechanical connections, mechatronics and adaptronics; size ranges and modular products; quality methods; and cost estimation methods. The book provides a comprehensive guide to successful product development for practising designers, students, and design educators. Fundamentals are emphasised throughout and short-term trends avoided; so the approach described provides a sound basis for design courses that help students move quickly and effectively into design practice. Engineering Design is widely acknowledged to be the most complete available treatise on systematic design methods. In it, each step of the engineering design process and associated best practices are documented. The book has particularly strong sections on design from the functional perspective and on the phase of the process between conceptual and detail design in which most key design decisions are made. The 3rd edition includes new material on project planning and scheduling. Anyone committed to understanding the design process should be familiar with the contents of this book.

abstract = {Introduction Hip fractures represent an important health-care dilemma, costing the US{\$} billions annually. Hip fractures can diminish quality of life and significantly increase morbidity and mortality if not properly treated. Recent research has brought forth new information regarding treatment as well as information on emerging complications seen within the fixation constructs themselves. Significance Understanding the pathoanatomy of hip fractures and the biomechanics of surgical fixation constructs is critical for successful treatment. In this article, we review the relevant anatomy and classification of femoral neck and intertrochanteric fractures. Furthermore, the biomechanics of hip fracture fixation strategies as well as implant-related complications are addressed. Results Even though laboratory testing demonstrated that intramedullary nails have greater biomechanical stability, the clinical results between fixation constructs have been similar when the chosen implant (ie, sliding hip screw vs cephalomedullary nail) has been correctly applied to the specific fracture pattern. Recently, data have shown that when using cephalomedullary nails, there is potential for increased failure with cutout when using the helical blade versus the lag screw, with majority being the atypical "medial cutout." Conclusion The goal of surgical treatment of hip fractures is surgical treatment that allows for early mobilization and weight bearing. A full understanding of the anatomy and fracture characteristics will allow the surgeon to correctly apply the right implant to allow for uneventful healing. Surgeons need to be aware, however, of complications that can arise when using specific implants. Further research is ongoing to further determine the treatments that will allow optimal cost-effective care for the geriatric patient with hip fracture.},

abstract = {Objective: Musculoskeletal models provide a non-invasive means to study human movement and predict the effects of interventions on gait. Our goal was to create an open-source 3-D musculoskeletal model with high-fidelity representations of the lower limb musculature of healthy young individuals that can be used to generate accurate simulations of gait. Methods: Our model includes bony geometry for the full body, 37 degrees of freedom to define joint kinematics, Hill-type models of 80 muscle-tendon units actuating the lower limbs, and 17 ideal torque actuators driving the upper body. The model's musculotendon parameters are derived from previous anatomical measurements of 21 cadaver specimens and magnetic resonance images of 24 young healthy subjects. We tested the model by evaluating its computational time and accuracy of simulations of healthy walking and running. Results: Generating muscle-driven simulations of normal walking and running took approximately 10 minutes on a typical desktop computer. The differences between our muscle-generated and inverse dynamics joint moments were within 3{\%} (RMSE) of the peak inverse dynamics joint moments in both walking and running, and our simulated muscle activity showed qualitative agreement with salient features from experimental electromyography data. Conclusion: These results suggest that our model is suitable for generating muscle-driven simulations of healthy gait. We encourage other researchers to further validate and apply the model to study other motions of the lower extremity. Significance: The model is implemented in the open-source software platform OpenSim.},

abstract = {A wearable robot called the ‘Exoskeleton' has been developed to assist in human activity in industrial and medical contexts. The Exoskeleton product interacts with the human body much more closely than do other products. Thus, it is important to know how much force the robot will generate before manufacturing the real Exoskeleton. The easiest and most accurate way to determine the force would be to develop a mock-up model for the physical test, but to do so would be very expensive. Thus, it is preferable to predict the force during the design stage using a virtual prototyping environment. In this research, a combined human-exoskeleton model is generated, and dynamics analysis is performed under two different constraints using the AnyBody Software to predict the effect of the strap connecting the user to the exoskeleton. For this purpose, an AnyBody human model is used after scaling, and a simplified exoskeleton model designed in a CAD system is converted to a dynamic model. Constraints are identified based on the human and exoskeleton models. The dynamic analysis will make it possible to calculate the human joint torque and the interaction force for the human model and the exoskeleton, and the significance of the effect of the strap can be determined.},

abstract = {Increasing skin wetness tends to increase fabric-skin adhesion and friction, resulting in wear discomfort or skin injuries. Here, the magnitude estimation approach was used to assess the stickiness sensation perceived in fabrics. Seven fabric types were wetted by putting onto wet 'skin' surface and dried for different durations to achieve different wetness levels, simulating wearing conditions during the recovery period after sweating. Results showed that the relationship between magnitude estimates of stickiness and amount of water present in fabric demonstrated a power function. The exponents and constant from power regression show the growth rate of stickiness sensation with moisture intensity and the perceived stickiness under fixed stimulus intensity, respectively. A novel parameter, accumulated stickiness magnitude (ASM), describing how much discomfort a wetted fabric offered throughout the drying period, was developed. Thin cotton fabrics (fabric W01 and W03), having higher saturation level after contacting with wetted skin surface, arouse stronger stickiness feeling and their ASM is remarkably higher. The difference in stickiness estimates is due to the difference in chemical composition and surface geometry. This study suggests us the way to predict perceived stickiness in fabrics with different wetness levels which is useful for applications like sportswear, intimate apparel or healthcare products.},

abstract = {A broad spectrum of issues have to be addressed in order to tackle the problem of a safe and dependable physical Human–Robot Interaction (pHRI). In the immediate future, metrics related to safety and dependability have to be found in order to successfully introduce robots in everyday enviornments. While there are certainly also “cognitive” issues involved, due to the human perception of the robot (and vice versa), and other objective metrics related to fault detection and isolation, our discussion focuses on the peculiar aspects of “physical” interaction with robots. In particular, safety and dependability are the underlying evaluation criteria for mechanical design, actuation, and control architectures. Mechanical and control issues are discussed with emphasis on techniques that provide safety in an intrinsic way or by means of control components. Attention is devoted to dependability, mainly related to sensors, control architectures, and fault handling and tolerance. Suggestions are provided to draft metrics for evaluating safety and dependability in pHRI, and references to the works of the scientific groups involved in the pHRI research complete the study. The present atlas is a result of the EURON perspective research project “Physical Human–Robot Interaction in anthropic DOMains (PHRIDOM)”, aimed at charting the new territory of pHRI, and constitutes the scientific basis for the ongoing STReP project “Physical Human–Robot Interaction: depENDability and Safety (PHRIENDS)”, aimed at developing key components for the next generation of robots, designed to share their environment with people.},

abstract = {This paper presents a tele-impedance based assistive control scheme for a knee exoskeleton device. The proposed controller captures the user's intent to generate task-related assistive torques by means of the exoskeleton in different phases of the subject's normal activity. To do so, a detailed musculoskeletal model of the human knee is developed and experimentally calibrated to best match the user's kinematic and dynamic behavior. Three dominant antagonistic muscle pairs are used in our model, in which electromyography (EMG) signals are acquired, processed and used for the estimation of the knee joint torque, trajectory and the stiffness trend, in real time. The estimated stiffness trend is then scaled and mapped to a task-related stiffness interval to agree with the desired degree of assistance. The desired stiffness and equilibrium trajectories are then tracked by the exoskeleton's impedance controller. As a consequence, while minimum muscular activity corresponds to low stiffness, i.e. highly transparent motion, higher co-contractions result in a stiffer joint and a greater level of assistance. To evaluate the robustness of the proposed technique, a study of the dynamics of the human-exoskeleton system is conducted, while the stability in the steady state and transient condition is investigated. In addition, experimental results of standing-up and sitting-down tasks are demonstrated to further investigate the capabilities of the controller. The results indicate that the compliant knee exoskeleton, incorporating the proposed tele-impedance controller, can effectively generate assistive actions that are volitionally and intuitively controlled by the user's muscle activity.},

Human subject's intention is represented by the reference trajectory when the robotic exoskeleton is complying with the external interaction force. Online estimation of the stiffness is employed to deal with the variable impedance property of the robotic exoskeleton. Admittance control is firstly presented based on the measured force in order to generate a reference trajectory in interaction tasks. Then adaptive control is proposed to deal with the uncertain robotic dynamics and a stability criterion can be obtained. Bounded errors are shown in the motion tracking while the robustness of the variable stiffness control is guaranteed. The experimental results indicate that the proposed control enables the human subjects to execute an admittance control task on the exoskeleton robot effectively. IEEE},

abstract = {Better running economy (i.e. a lower rate of energy consumption at a given speed) is correlated with superior distance running performance. There is substantial variation in running economy, even among elite runners. This variation might be due to variation in the storage and reutilization of elastic energy in tendons. Using a simple musculoskeletal model, it was predicted that the amount of energy stored in a tendon during a given movement depends more critically on moment arm than on mechanical properties of the tendon, with the amount of stored energy increasing as the moment arm gets smaller. Assuming a link between elastic energy reutilization and overall metabolic cost of running, a smaller moment arm should therefore be associated with superior running economy. This prediction was confirmed experimentally in a group of 15 highly trained runners. The moment arm of the Achilles tendon was determined from standardized photographs of the ankle, using the position of anatomical landmarks. Running economy was measured as the rate of metabolic energy consumption during level treadmill running at a speed of 16 km h-1. A strong correlation was found between the moment arm of the Achilles tendon and running economy. Smaller muscle moment arms correlated with lower rates of metabolic energy consumption (r2=0.75, P{\textless}0.001).},

All patients who required removal of a self-locking wedge-type subtalar arthroereisis were identified between 2002 and 2008. Propensity scores matched 22 explanted subtalar arthroereises to 44 controls (nonexplanted arthroereises), resulting in a total of 66 implants that met all inclusion and exclusion criteria. Multivariate logistic regression found that patients who required explantation had a greater odds of radiographic undercorrection, determined from radiographic anteroposterior talar-first metatarsal angles postoperatively, P = .0012, odds ratio (OR) = 1.175 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.066 to 1.295), or residual transverse plane-dominant deformities, as determined from radiographic calcaneocuboid abduction angles postoperatively, P = .05, OR = 1.096 (95{\%} CI 1.06 to 1.203).

abstract = {The interface stresses between the residual limb and prosthetic socket have been studied to investigate prosthetic fit. Finite-element models of the residual limb-prosthetic socket interface facilitate investigation of the mechanical interface and may serve as a potential tool for future prosthetic socket design. However, the success of such residual limb models to date has been limited, in large part due to inadequate material formulations used to approximate the mechanical behavior of residual limb soft tissues. Nonlinear finite-element analysis was used to simulate force-displacement data obtained during in vivo rate-controlled (1, 5, and 10 mm/s) cyclic indentation of the residual limb soft tissues of seven individuals with transtibial amputation. The finite-element models facilitated determination of an appropriate set of nonlinear elastic material coefficients for bulk soft tissue at discrete clinically relevant test locations. Axisymmetric finite-element models of the residual limb bulk soft tissue in the vicinity of the test location, the socket wall and the indentor tip were developed incorporating contact analysis, large displacement, and large strain, and the James-Green-Simpson nonlinear elastic material formulation. Model dimensions were based on medical imaging studies of the residual limbs. The material coefficients were selected such that the normalized sum of square error (NSSE) between the experimental and finite-element model indentor tip reaction force was minimized. A total of 95{\%} of the experimental data were simulated using the James-Green-Simpson material formulation with an NSSE less than 5{\%}. The respective James-Green-Simpson material coefficients varied with subject, test location, and indentation rate. Therefore, these coefficients cannot be readily extrapolated to other sites or individuals, or to the same site and individual some time after testing.},

abstract = {Adult stem cells reside in unique niches that provide vital cues for their survival, self-renewal and differentiation. In order to better understand the contribution of substrate stiffness to neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) differentiation and proliferation, a photopolymerizable methacrylamide chitosan (MAC) biomaterial was developed. Photopolymerizable MAC is particularly compelling for the study of the central nervous system stem cell niche because Young's elastic modulus (EY) can be tuned from less than 1kPa to greater than 30kPa. Additionally, the numerous free amine functional groups enable inclusion of biochemical signaling molecules that, together with the mechanical environment, influence cell behavior. Herein, NSPCs proliferated on MAC substrates with Young's elastic moduli below 10kPa and exhibited maximal proliferation on 3.5kPa surfaces. Neuronal differentiation was favored on the softest surfaces with EY{\textless}1kPa as confirmed by both immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR. Oligodendrocyte differentiation was favored on stiffer scaffolds ({\textgreater}7kPa); however, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) gene expression suggested that oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination was best on {\textless}1kPa scaffolds where more mature neurons were present. Astrocyte differentiation was only observed on {\textless}1 and 3.5kPa surfaces and represented less than 2{\%} of the total cell population. This work demonstrates the importance of substrate stiffness to the proliferation and differentiation of adult NSPCs and highlights the importance of mechanical properties to the success of scaffolds designed to engineer central nervous system tissue.},

abstract = {Objective: Hypertension is among the most common chronic complaints of older people. Among very old people with common co morbidities, it remains uncertain whether the benefits of long-term treatment seen among younger people, are also observed. Our objective was to assess the relationship of blood pressure (BP) at age 85 with 5-year all-cause mortality. Design: A longitudinal prospective cohort study, of an age-homogenous, representative sample born 1920-1921. Setting: Community-based home assessments. Participants: West Jerusalem residents (1159) born 1920-1921, all aged age 85 during 2005-2006, currently enrolled in the Jerusalem Longitudinal Study. Intervention: None. Measurements: Comprehensive geriatric assessment of numerous health variables. BP was determined as the average of 6 measurements, from 2 separate home visits. Hypertension (HTN) defined as either treatment with antihypertensive medications, or blood pressure {\textgreater}140 mm Hg systolic, or {\textgreater}90 mm Hg. The study outcome was all-cause 5-year mortality. Mortality data were collected from the National Ministry of Interior. Results: One hundred and nine (9.4{\%}) were normotensive, 152 (13.1{\%}) untreated, and 898 (77.5{\%}) treated hypertensives. Treatment rate was 78{\%}, and controlled hypertension rate 38{\%}. During 5 years 328 (28.3{\%}) patients died. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log rank analysis showed no difference in mortality between normotensive, untreated and treated hypertensive subjects according to sex. Treated subjects with controlled Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) had lowest survival rate of 67{\%}, P = .029. Continuous SBP yielded a hazard ratio (HR) for mortality of 1.00, (95{\%} CI 0.95-1.01), after adjusting in Cox proportional hazard models for sex, heart failure, physical activity, self-rated health, diabetes, coronary and cerebrovascular diseases, smoking and antihypertensive therapy. Results were unaffected after excluding 114 deaths within the first 2-years of follow-up. Similar results were found when examining BP either as a dichotomous variable, according to treatment, or pulse pressure. Conclusions: Raised SBP was not associated with increased 5-year mortality among a representative cohort of community-dwelling 85-year-olds. Indeed, before adjustment for co morbidities, subjects with controlled SBP tended to have a worse survival. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Medical Directors Association, Inc.},

abstract = {Hand injuries are a frequent problem. The great amount of hand injuries is not only a problem for the affected people but economic consequences follow because rehabilitation takes a long time. To improve therapy results and reduce cost of rehabilitation a hand exoskeleton was developed. For research on control algorithms and rehabilitation programs a prototype supporting all four degrees of freedom of one finger was build (s. Fig. 1). In view of the fact that a lot of hand injuries affect only one finger, this prototype could already be functional in physical therapy. A robust-sliding mode controller was proposed for motion control of the hand exoskeleton. The performance of the controller was evaluated for step response. In a second experiment varied forces where applied during the sensor was set to hold a constant position. Finally the controller was set to follow a complete trajectory.},

abstract = {This paper outlines an experimentally based design method for a compatible 3-DOF shoulder exoskeleton with an adaptive center of rotation (CoR) by matching the mechanical CoR with the anatomical CoR to reduce human-machine interaction forces and improve comfort during dynamic humeral motion. The spatial-temporal description for anatomical CoR motion is obtained via a specific experimental task conducted on six healthy subjects. The task is comprised of a static section and a dynamic section, both of which are recorded with an infrared motion capture system using body-attached markers. To reduce the influence of human soft tissues, a custom-made four-marker group block was placed on the upper arm instead of using discrete markers. In the static section, the position of anatomical CoR is kept stationary and calculated using a well-known functional method. Based on the static results, the dynamic section determines the statistical relationship between the dynamic CoR position and the humeral orientation using an optimization method when subjects move their upper arm freely in the sagittal and coronal planes. Based on the resolved anatomical CoR motion, a new mechanical CoR model derived from a traditional ball-and-socket joint is applied to match the experimental results as closely as possible. In this mechanical model, the CoR motion in three-dimensional space is adjusted by translating two of the three intersecting joint axes, including the shoulder abduction/adduction and flexion/extension. A set of optimal translation parameters is obtained through proper matching criterion for the two CoRs. Based on the translation parameters, a compatible shoulder exoskeleton was manufactured and compared with a traditional shoulder exoskeleton with a fixed CoR. An experimental test was conducted to validate the CoR motion adaptation ability by measuring the human-machine interaction force during passive shoulder joint motion. The results provide a promising direction for future anthropomorphic shoulder exoskeleton design.},

abstract = {This paper presents a medical robotic system for tool positioning tasks in orthopaedic surgery. The system consists of an 7 DOF upper limb exoskeleton, which is attached to the arm and back of an orthopaedic surgeon, and a real-time control system with an optical tracking camera. The objective is to guide the surgeon during an operation task to follow a predefined trajectory with a surgical tool. Therefore, a control algorithm is introduced to minimize the positioning error between the desired and actual pose (position and orientation) of the tool tip. The required joint velocities for positioning tasks are obtained by solving the inverse kinematic problem of the serial kinematic chain using an extended Jacobian method. For the computation the Jacobian matrix, a geometric approach is chosen to solve the forward kinematics problem of the manipulator links. The over-determined kinematic system of the redundant robotic manipulator is determined using basic kinematic constraints of the human joint angles. Results of the inverse kinematics solution are evaluated with simulations of positioning trajectories for drilling tasks of the robotic manipulator and show a deviation of the desired path of less than 0.8 mm. The implemented end-effector positioning controller produces satisfactory results and enables future extensions for intuitive human-machine interaction control.},

abstract = {Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is associated with alterations in gait. As an alternative to force plates, instrumented force shoes (IFSs) can be used to measure ground reaction forces. This study evaluated the influence of IFS on gait pattern in patients with knee OA. Twenty patients with knee OA walked in a gait laboratory on IFS and control shoes (CSs). An optoelectronic system and force plate were used to perform 3D gait analyses. A comparison of temporal-spatial gait parameters, kinematics, and kinetics was made between IFS and CS. Patients wearing IFS showed a decrease in walking velocity and cadence (8{\%}), unchanged stride length, an increase in stance time (13{\%}), stride time (11{\%}) and step width (14{\%}). No differences were found in knee adduction moment or knee kinematics. Small differences were found in foot and ankle kinematics (2-5°), knee transverse moments (5{\%}), ankle frontal (3{\%}) and sagittal moments (1{\%}) and ground reaction force (1-6{\%}). The gait of patients with knee OA was only mildly influenced by the IFS, due to increased shoe height and weight and a change in sole stiffness. The changes were small compared to normal variation and clinically relevant differences. Importantly, in OA patients no effect was found on the knee adduction moment. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.},

abstract = {In virtual modelling of exoskeletons, the human-exoskeleton interface is often simplified by modelling the interface forces at a single point instead of contact forces due to the straps or cuffs. In the past, force-generating elements (FGEs) have been used to predict ground reaction forces. However, unlike the ground, which is a planar surface, the human-exoskeleton interface presents curved surfaces. This work discusses the modifications required for using the FGEs for predicting the curved human-exoskeleton interface forces of a passive lower-limb exoskeleton, the Chairless Chair. A pressure mat was positioned at the human-exoskeleton interface to measure the area of contact and the centre of pressure (CoP) in three different sitting conditions. The strength of the FGEs was analysed in detail and its optimization based on the model outputs is discussed. The strength affects the model assistance and the CoP, and these outputs could be used to identify the optimal value of the strength. The strength of the FGEs affects the biomechanical outputs from the model also. Therefore, it is crucial to select the correct value of the strength. The results of this work would be useful for the detailed modelling of the human-exoskeleton interface.},

abstract = {Musculoskeletal models of the hand rarely include fingerpad contact mechanics, thereby limiting our ability to simulate and examine hand-object interactions. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether two common contact models (Hunt-Crossley and Elastic Foundation) can accurately represent the fingerpad. Two musculoskeletal models of the index finger were created by adding fingerpad contact geometry using either the Hunt-Crossley or Elastic Foundation contact models. Key contact parameters (target force, contact area, and stiffness) were then systematically varied through 432 forward dynamic simulations to examine how these parameters influenced estimation of finger-tip forces. Across all simulations, variation in target force, contact area, and stiffness parameters impacted the computation time required to complete the simulations and the accuracy of the predicted finger-tip force. Computation time was over three times longer in simulations with high versus low values of contact area and stiffness in both contact models. For both contact models, larger contact area and stiffness values resulted in simulations that more closely predicted target force. However, across all simulations, the Hunt-Crossley model produced a greater proportion of accurate finger-tip force simulations than the Elastic Foundation model, suggesting that the Hunt-Crossley contact model may be preferable for modeling the fingerpad. Overall, our study demonstrates how the Hunt-Crossley and Elastic Foundation contact models behave in low-force biomechanical scenarios, such as those experienced during hand-object manipulation, and provides a foundation for incorporating contact mechanics into musculoskeletal models of the hand.},

This paper presents a robotic wrist whose size, range, and torque output are comparable to those of a human wrist. To achieve two collocated and perpendicular axes of compliant actuation, two linear compliant couplers are proposed. Through slider crank and spherical mechanisms, the linear elasticity is converted to rotary elasticity to control the pitch and yaw torques at the same time. This new compact design realizes series elastic actuation in both axes without increasing size and complexity. Static and dynamic models of the compliant wrist are developed to analyze the motion. Through experiments of a prototype, the wrist is shown to achieve accurate and fast force/torque control.

abstract = {Physics-based simulations of walking have the theoretical potential to support clinical decision-making by predicting the functional outcome of treatments in terms of walking performance. Yet before using such simulations in clinical practice, their ability to identify the main treatment targets in specific patients needs to be demonstrated. In this study, we generated predictive simulations of walking with a medical imaging based neuro-musculoskeletal model of a child with cerebral palsy presenting crouch gait. We explored the influence of altered muscle-tendon properties, reduced neuromuscular control complexity, and spasticity on gait dysfunction in terms of joint kinematics, kinetics, muscle activity, and metabolic cost of transport. We modeled altered muscle-tendon properties by personalizing Hill-type muscle-tendon parameters based on data collected during functional movements, simpler neuromuscular control by reducing the number of independent muscle synergies, and spasticity through delayed muscle activity feedback from muscle force and force rate. Our simulations revealed that, in the presence of aberrant musculoskeletal geometries, altered muscle-tendon properties rather than reduced neuromuscular control complexity and spasticity were the primary cause of the crouch gait pattern observed for this child, which is in agreement with the clinical examination. These results suggest that muscle-tendon properties should be the primary target of interventions aiming to restore an upright gait pattern for this child. This suggestion is in line with the gait analysis following muscle-tendon property and bone deformity corrections.

abstract = {A critical issue in the model-based control of performance-augmenting exoskeleton systems is the unknown nonlinear dynamic properties of the systems or the uncertainties. An improper estimation of the system dynamics can cause instabilities in the system and generate considerable human-exoskeleton interaction forces during human motions. Thus, the controller of such exoskeleton systems needs to add robustness to stabilize it against the uncertainties. In this paper, we propose a global fast sliding mode control algorithm integrated in a hybrid controller for each exoskeleton leg to minimize human-exoskeleton interaction forces. By doing so, the proposed algorithm does not require an exact estimation of the dynamic properties of the exoskeleton system, but still minimizes the physical human-exoskeleton interaction (pHEI) forces. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by experiments on our lower exoskeleton system, which is used for human power augmentation and called PRMI exoskeleton. Our experimental results show that the proposed control algorithm provides a good control quality for the PRMI exoskeleton. The PRMI exoskeleton can support a wearer carrying heavy load while tracking the rapid movements of the wearer without obstructing them.},

The experimental setup based on F-Socket Tekscan pressure system is described as well the results of some static loading tests. Pressure data are visualized with a colour pressure map over the 3D model of the residual limb acquired using an optical low cost scanner, based on MS Kinect. Previous methodology is useful to evaluate a physical prototype; in order to improve also conceptual design, the Finite Element (FE) Analysis has been carried and results reached so far have been compared with experimental tests. Pressure distributions are comparable, even if some discrepancies have been highlighted due to sensors placements and implemented FE model.

abstract = {For partial lower-limb exoskeletons, an accurate real-time estimation of the gait phase is paramount to provide timely and well-tailored assistance during gait. To this end, dedicated wearable sensors separated from the exoskeletons mechanical structure may be preferable because they are typically isolated from movement artifacts that often result from the transient dynamics of the physical human-robot interaction. Moreover, wearable sensors that do not require time-consuming calibration procedures are more easily acceptable by users. In this paper, a robotic hip orthosis was controlled using capacitive sensors placed in orthopedic cuffs on the shanks. The capacitive signals are zeroed after donning the cuffs and do not require any further calibration. The capacitive-sensing-based controller was designed to perform online estimation of the gait cycle phase via adaptive oscillators, and to provide a phase-locked assistive torque. Two experimental activities were carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. Experiments conducted with seven healthy subjects walking on a treadmill at different speeds demonstrated that the controller can estimate the gait phase with an average error of 4{\%}, while also providing hip flexion assistance. Moreover, experiments carried out with four healthy subjects showed that the capacitive-sensing-based controller could reduce the metabolic expenditure of subjects compared to the unassisted condition (mean SEM,-3.2{\%} 1.1).},

abstract = {Muscle-driven simulations of human and animal motion are widely used to complement physical experiments for studying movement dynamics. Musculotendon models are an essential component of muscle-driven simulations, yet neither the computational speed nor the biological accuracy of the simulated forces has been adequately evaluated. Here we compare the speed and accuracy of three musculotendon models: two with an elastic tendon (an equilibrium model and a damped equilibrium model) and one with a rigid tendon. Our simulation benchmarks demonstrate that the equilibrium and damped equilibrium models produce similar force profiles but have different computational speeds. At low activation, the damped equilibrium model is 29 times faster than the equilibrium model when using an explicit integrator and 3 times faster when using an implicit integrator; at high activation, the two models have similar simulation speeds. In the special case of simulating a muscle with a short tendon, the rigid-tendon model produces forces that match those generated by the elastic-tendon models, but simulates 2-54 times faster when an explicit integrator is used and 6-31 times faster when an implicit integrator is used. The equilibrium, damped equilibrium, and rigid-tendon models reproduce forces generated by maximally-activated biological muscle with mean absolute errors less than 8.9{\%}, 8.9{\%}, and 20.9{\%} of the maximum isometric muscle force, respectively. When compared to forces generated by submaximally-activated biological muscle, the forces produced by the equilibrium, damped equilibrium, and rigid-tendon models have mean absolute errors less than 16.2{\%}, 16.4{\%}, and 18.5{\%}, respectively. To encourage further development of musculotendon models, we provide implementations of each of these models in OpenSim version 3.1 and benchmark data online, enabling others to reproduce our results and test their models of musculotendon dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

abstract = {Robotic gait training is gaining ground in rehabilitation. Room for improvement lies in reducing donning and doffing time, making training more task specific and facilitating active balance control, and by allowing movement in more degrees of freedom. Our goal was to design and evaluate a robot that incorporates these improvements. LOPES II uses an end-effector approach with parallel actuation and a minimum amount of clamps. LOPES II has eight powered degrees of freedom (hip flexion/extension, hip abduction/adduction, knee flexion/extension, pelvis forward/aft and pelvis mediolateral). All other degrees of freedom can be left free and pelvis frontal- and transversal rotation can be constrained. Furthermore arm swing is unhindered. The end-effector approach eliminates the need for exact alignment, which results in a donning time of 10-14 min for first-time training and 5-8 min for recurring training. LOPES II is admittance controlled, which allows for the control over the complete spectrum from low to high impedance. When the powered degrees of freedom are set to minimal impedance, walking in the device resembles free walking, which is an important requisite to allow task-specific training. We demonstrated that LOPES II can provide sufficient support to let severely affected patients walk and that we can provide selective support to impaired aspects of gait of mildly affected patients.},

abstract = {One of the critical aspects in the design of an assistive wearable robot is the energy efficiency of the actuation system, since it significantly affects the weight and consequently the comfort of the system. Several strategies have been used in previous research, mostly based on energy harvesting, compliant elements for mechanical energy accumulation (springs or elastic cords), ratchets, and clutches. However, the design of the optimal actuator arrangement is highly dependent on the task, which increases significantly the complexity of the design process. In this letter, we present an energy efficiency analysis and design optimization of an actuation system applied to a soft module lower limb exoskeleton. Instead of performing a comparison between predefined mechanism arrangements, we solve a full optimization problem that includes not only the mechanism parameters, but also the mechanism architecture itself. The optimization is performed for a walking task using gait data from a stroke subject, and the result is a set of actuator arrangements with optimal parameters for the analyzed task and selected user. The optimized mechanism is able to reduce the energy requirements by 20-65{\%}, depending on the joint. The proposed mechanism is currently under development within the XoSoft EU project, a modular soft lower-limb exoskeleton to assist people with mobility impairments.},

In this paper, the authors designed RoboWear that has active 7 DOF with suitable device to be worn by a human operator.

An operator wearing the robot arm can move around freely, because this robot is designed to have its base supported at the shoulder part of the operator. The total weight of the proposed robot arm is approximately 4 kg. Pneumatic actuators are used to reduce the total weight of the robot, to improve compliance with human motion and to generate high reactive forces. The feasibility of the wearable robot is demonstrated by examining the control performance and by incorporating the wearable robot with virtual environment.},

Although joint degrees of freedom (DOF) in the frontal plane are important for lateral balance, the number of active joint DOFs is also responsible for increase in robot size and weight. The Interlimb Parallel-link Powered Orthosis (IPPO), a newly developed wearable robot with a compact drive mechanism based on the medial system, forms the subject of this paper. IPPO has 9 active DOFs including a mechanism allowing the simultaneous movement of the stance hip adduction and swing hip abduction using one actuator. Two experiments were conducted for a preliminary proof-of-concept study wherein the standing posture center of pressure was evaluated amidst the lateral sway induced by IPPO. We confirmed that our prototype could assist the lateral movement of the user's body center of mass. In the performance experiment of walking on a treadmill, the results showed that the arm loading forces and arm muscle activities were reduced when the lateral weight bearing was assisted by IPPO. We conclude that the lateral weight bearing mechanism is feasible and effective for reducing arm loading by assisting the lateral weight bearing during walking.},

abstract = {To achieve ideal force control of a functional autonomous exoskeleton, sensitivity amplification control is widely used in human strength augmentation applications. The original sensitivity amplification control aims to increase the closed-loop control system sensitivity based on positive feedback without any sensors between the pilot and the exoskeleton. Thus, the measurement system can be greatly simplified. Nevertheless, the controller lacks the ability to reject disturbance and has little robustness to the variation of the parameters. Consequently, a relatively precise dynamic model of the exoskeleton system is desired. Moreover, the human-robot interaction (HRI) cannot be interpreted merely as a particular part of the driven torque quantitatively. Therefore, a novel control methodology, so-called probabilistic sensitivity amplification control, is presented in this paper. The innovation of the proposed control algorithm is two-fold: distributed hidden-state identification based on sensor observations and evolving learning of sensitivity factors for the purpose of dealing with the variational HRI. Compared to the other state-of-the-art algorithms, we verify the feasibility of the probabilistic sensitivity amplification control with several experiments, i.e., distributed identification model learning and walking with a human subject. The experimental result shows potential application feasibility.},

We use a factorization approach to learn 3D motion coefficients and join them with physical parameters, that describe the dynamic of a mass-spring-model. Our approach does neither require additional force measurement nor torque optimization and only uses a single camera while allowing to estimate unobservable torques in the human body. We show that our algorithm improves the monocular 3D reconstruction by enforcing plausible human motion and resolving the ambiguity of camera and object motion.The performance is evaluated on different motions and multiple test data sets as well as on challenging outdoor sequences.},

abstract = {Exoskeletons are new robotic systems that are in close contact with the human body. Thus, their performances are influenced by many factors, including the selection of its structure, actuators, measurement devices, parameters, and mechanism of coupling to the human body. The latter offers numerous challenges to its design, evaluation and modification, including analyzing the effectiveness of the exoskeleton, finding the optimal force for actuators and, discovering the effect of changes in design parameters on human muscle behavior, which are very difficult to measure. Therefore, numerical simulations play an important role in solving these challenges and have the potential to improve treatment strategies and medical decision-making. In this study, a simulation-based method is presented for the designing and analysis of the parameters of an exoskeleton and its wearer's kinetics and kinematics. Model-based design software, including OpenSim and Inventor, and mathematical software, such as MATLAB, are integrated. This method can assist in the modification of exoskeleton devices and allow physiologists, neuroscientists, and physical therapists to generate new solutions for rehabilitation programs using exoskeletons. • Using the movements parameters of each individual subject in her/his exoskeleton design. • Combining the power of OpenSim body movement and the ability of Matlab in mathematical calculations. • Considering the effect of exoskeleton parameters on each muscle-skeleton movement.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Imaging study of thoracic spine. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate dynamic alignment and range of motion (ROM) at all segmental levels of thoracic spine. Thoracic spine is considered to have restricted ROM because of restriction by the rib cage. However, angular movements of thoracic spine can induce thoracic compressive myelopathy in some patients. Although few previous studies have reported segmental ROM with regard to sagittal plane, these were based on cadaver specimens. No study has reported normal functional ROM of thoracic spine. METHODS: Fifty patients with cervical or lumbar spinal disease but neither thoracic spinal disease nor compression fracture were enrolled prospectively in this study (34 males, 16 females; mean age 55.4 ± 14.7 years; range 27-81 years). After preoperative myelography, multidetector-row computed tomography scanning was performed at passive maximum flexion and extension position. Total and segmental thoracic kyphotic angles were measured and ROM calculated. RESULTS: Total kyphotic angle (T1/L1) was 40.2° ± 11.4° and 8.5° ± 12.8° in flexion and extension, respectively (P {\textless} 0.0001). The apex of the kyphotic angle was at T6/7 in flexion. Total ROM (T1/L1) was 31.7° ± 11.3°. Segmental ROM decreased from T1/2 to T4/5 but increased gradually from T4/5 to T12/L1. Maximum ROM was at T12/L1 (4.2° ± 2.1°) and minimum at T4/5 (0.9° ± 3.0°). CONCLUSIONS: Thoracic spine showed ROM in sagittal plane, despite being considered a stable region. These findings offer useful information in the diagnosis and selection of surgical intervention in thoracic spinal disease.},

Each module's actuation unit employs a Series Elastic Actuator (SEA) to achieve passive compliance. The hip exoskeleton can work in two basic operation modes: human-in-charge and robot-in-charge. Both modes are integrated into the low-level controller based on the admittance control, making transitions smooth and stable.

Primarily due to computational considerations, most of the past real-time surgical simulation research has assumed linear elastic behaviour for modelling tissues, even though human soft tissues generally possess non-linear properties. For a non-linear model, the well-known Poynting effect developed during shearing of the tissue results in normal forces not seen in a linear elastic model. Using constitutive equations of non-linear tissue models together with experiments, we show that the Poynting effect results in differences in force magnitude larger than the absolute human perception threshold for force discrimination in some tissues (e.g. myocardial tissues) but not in others (e.g. brain tissue simulants). {\textcopyright} 2010 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

We learn a model of soft-tissue deformations from examples using a high-resolution 4D capture system and a method that accurately registers a template mesh to sequences of 3D scans. Using over 40,000 scans of ten subjects, we learn how soft- tissue motion causes mesh triangles to deform relative to a base 3D body model. Our Dyna model uses a low-dimensional linear subspace to approximate soft-tissue deformation and relates the subspace coefficients to the changing pose of the body. Dyna uses a second-order auto-regressive model that predicts soft-tissue deformations based on previous deformations, the velocity and acceleration of the body, and the angular velocities and accelerations of the limbs. Dyna also models how deformations vary with a person's body mass index (BMI), producing different deformations for people with different shapes. Dyna realistically represents the dynamics of soft tissue for previously unseen subjects and motions. We provide tools for animators to modify the deformations and apply them to new stylized characters.},

@article{Hyun2017,
abstract = {This paper proposes the design of an electricity-powered lower-limb exoskeleton called “Human Universal Mobility Assistance (HUMA)”. HUMA was developed as a research platform with the objective of providing its wearer with weight-bearing assistance for human strength/endurance augmentation. It has 12 degrees of active/spring passive/free passive freedom to assist human locomotion. The artificial leg has two electricity-powered degrees of freedom (DoFs) for hip/knee flexions/extensions, passive spring-installed two DoFs for ankle inversion/eversion and plantarflexion/dorsiflexion, and two free, passive DoFs for hip roll/yaw movements. HUMA has mechanical structures for active artificial hip and knee joints; the hip actuator is not directly connected to the robot's leg system, but a universal joint is installed between the actuator and the leg system to allow a free coaxial hip yaw/roll DoF for the wearer. Therefore, the hip-actuating torque is transferred solely for hip flexion/extension. Its active artificial knee is structured by a four bar-based polycentric linkage, and is power=driven by an actuator in the middle of the robot's thigh segment through the other four bar-based power transmission linkage. This powered knee structure yields several advantages related to (1) human–robot knee alignment during leg motion, (2) the expansion of the zone of voluntary knee stability, (3) the angle-dependent variable knee torque/velocity amplification ratio, and (4) a reduction in the total moment of artificial leg inertia. The exoskeleton was tested for dynamic gait by using assistive torques determined by a control algorithm. Experiments were conducted on the robot while it walked at 5 km/h ( ≈ 1 . 39 m/s) with/without a 20 kg load, as well as for a 10-km/h ( ≈ 2 . 78 m/s) run.},

abstract = {When a human is interacting physically with a robot to accomplish a task, his/her posture is inevitably influenced by the robot movement. Since the human is not controllable, an active robot imposing a collaborative trajectory should predict the most likely human posture. This prediction should consider individual differences and preferences of movement execution, and it is necessary to evaluate the impact of the robot's action from an ergonomics standpoint. Here, we propose a method to predict, in probabilistic terms, the human postures of an individual for a given robot trajectory executed in a collaborative scenario. We formalize the problem as the prediction of the human joints velocity given the current posture and robot end-effector velocity. The key idea of our approach is to learn the distribution of the null space of the Jacobian and the weights of the weighted pseudo-inverse from demonstrated human movements: both carry information about human postural preferences, to leverage redundancy and ensure that the predicted posture will be coherent with the end-effector position. We validate our approach in a simulated toy problem and on two real human-robot interaction experiments where a human is physically interacting with a Franka robot.},

abstract = {Knowledge of human-exoskeleton interaction forces is crucial to assess user comfort and effectiveness of the interaction. The subject-exoskeleton collaborative movement and its interaction forces can be predicted in silico using computational modeling techniques. We developed an optimal control framework that consisted of three phases. First, the foot-ground (Phase A) and the subject-exoskeleton (Phase B) contact models were calibrated using three experimental sit-to-stand trials. Then, the collaborative movement and the subject-exoskeleton interaction forces, of six different sit-to-stand trials were predicted (Phase C). The results show that the contact models were able to reproduce experimental kinematics of calibration trials (mean root mean square differences - RMSD - coordinates ≤ 1.1° and velocities ≤ 6.8°/s), ground reaction forces (mean RMSD≤ 22.9 N), as well as the interaction forces at the pelvis, thigh, and shank (mean RMSD ≤ 5.4 N). Phase C could predict the collaborative movements of prediction trials (mean RMSD coordinates ≤ 3.5° and velocities ≤ 15.0°/s), and their subject-exoskeleton interaction forces (mean RMSD ≤ 13.1° N). In conclusion, this optimal control framework could be used while designing exoskeletons to have in silico knowledge of new optimal movements and their interaction forces.},

Varying the implemented gravity compensating factor indicates potential of adjusting partial muscle relief and inner reaction forces and moments using an active upper limb exoskeleton. The analysis points out that; compared to muscle activations; inner human reaction forces and moments request different control parameter configurations for an assumed optimal assistance.},

@article{Dragomir-Daescu2018a,
abstract = {Many researchers have used cadaveric fracture tests to determine the relationship between proximal femur (hip) fracture strength and a multitude of possible explanatory variables, typically considered one or two at a time. These variables include subject-specific proximal femur variables such as femoral neck areal bone mineral density (aBMD), sex, age, and geometry, as well as physiological hip fracture event variables such as fall speed and angle of impact. However, to our knowledge, no study has included all of these variables simultaneously in the same experimental dataset. To address this gap, the present study simultaneously included all of these subject-specific and fracture event variables in multivariate models to understand their contributions to femoral strength and fracture type. The primary aim of this study was to determine not only whether each of these variables contributed to the prediction of femoral strength, but also to determine the relative importance of each variable in strength prediction. A secondary aim was to similarly characterize the importance of these variables for the prediction of fracture type. To accomplish these aims, we characterized 197 proximal femurs (covering a wide range of subject-specific variables) with DXA and CT scans, and then tested the femurs to fracture in a sideways fall on the hip configuration. Each femur was tested using one of three fall speed conditions and one of four angles of impact (bone orientations). During each test, we acquired measurements of relevant force and displacement data. We then reduced the test data to determine femoral strength, and we used post-fracture CT scans to classify the fracture type (e.g., trochanteric, cervical). Using these results, the explanatory variables were analyzed with mixed statistical models to explain variations in hip fracture strength and fracture type, respectively. Five explanatory variables were statistically significant in explaining the variability in femoral strength: aBMD, sex, age, fall speed, and neck-shaft angle (P ≤ 0.0135). These five variables, including significant interactions, explained 80{\%} of the variability in hip fracture strength. Additionally, when only aBMD, sex, and age (P {\textless} 0.0001) were considered in the model, again including significant interactions, these three variables alone explained 79{\%} of the variability in hip fracture strength. So while fall speed (P = 0.0135) and neck-shaft angle (P = 0.0041) were statistically significant, the inclusion of these variables did not appreciably improve the prediction of hip fracture strength compared to the model that considered only aBMD, sex and age. For the variables we included in this study, in the ranges we considered, our findings indicate that the clinically-available information of patient age, sex and aBMD are sufficient for femoral strength assessment. These findings also suggest that there is little value in the extra effort required to characterize the effect of femoral geometry on strength, or to account for the probabilistic nature of fall-related factors such as fall speed and angle of impact. For fracture type, the only explanatory variable found to be significant was aBMD (P ≤ 0.0099). We found that the odds of having intertrochanteric fractures increased by 47{\%} when aBMD decreased by one standard deviation (0.2 g/cm2).},

abstract = {Skeletal muscle architecture is defined as the arrangement of fibers in a muscle and functionally defines performance capacity. Architectural values are used to model muscle-joint behavior and to make surgical decisions. The two most extensively used human lower extremity data sets consist of five total specimens of unknown size, gender, and age. Therefore, it is critically important to generate a high-fidelity human lower extremity muscle architecture data set. We disassembled 27 muscles from 21 human lower extremities to characterize muscle fiber length and physiologic cross-sectional area, which define the excursion and force-generating capacities of a muscle. Based on their architectural features, the soleus, gluteus medius, and vastus lateralis are the strongest muscles, whereas the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus have the largest excursion. The plantarflexors, knee extensors, and hip adductors are the strongest muscle groups acting at each joint, whereas the hip adductors and hip extensors have the largest excursion. Contrary to previous assertions, two-joint muscles do not necessarily have longer fibers than single-joint muscles as seen by the similarity of knee flexor and extensor fiber lengths. These high-resolution data will facilitate the development of more accurate musculoskeletal models and challenge existing theories of muscle design; we believe they will aid in surgical decision making. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons.},

However, the calculation method for the supplied energy of the physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) is not addressed by considering the viscoelasticity of the human soft tissue. This paper presents four collision modes for classifying the pHRI and proposes a generic method for calculating the supplied energy of each collision mode. Consequently, specific calculation instances are given by treating the human soft tissue as a three-element Maxwell model with maximum/allowable compressive displacement. The feasibility and precision of the proposed calculation method are verified by comparing the computational and simulation results. This calculation method is intended to provide a way of directly determining or indirectly converting the allowable velocity or mass of an approaching robot.},

Methods: An observational study on 1,229 consecutive patients of 50 years and older, who sustained a hip fracture between January 2005 and June 2009. Fractures were scored retrospectively for 2005-2008 and prospectively for 2008-2009. Rates of a contralateral hip and other osteoporosis- related fractures were compared between patients with and without a history of a fracture. Previous fractures, gender, age and ASA classification were analysed as possible risk factors. Results: The absolute risk for a contralateral hip fracture was 13.8 {\%}, for one or more osteoporosis-related fracture( s) 28.6 {\%}. First-, second- and third-year risk for a second hip fracture was 2, 1 and 0 {\%}. Median (IQR) interval between both hip fractures was 18.5 (26.6) months. One-year incidence of other fractures was 6 {\%}. Only age was a risk factor for a contralateral hip fracture, hazard ratio (HR) 1.02 (1.006-1.042, p = 0.008). Patients with a history of a fracture (33.1 {\%}) did not have a higher incidence of fractures during follow-up (16.7 {\%}) than patients without fractures in their history (14 {\%}). HR for a contralateral hip fracture for the fracture versus the non-fracture group was 1.29 (0.75-2.23, p = 0.360). Conclusion: The absolute risk of a contralateral hip fracture after a hip fracture is 13.8 {\%}, the 1-year risk was 2 {\%}, with a short interval between the 2 hip fractures. Age was a risk factor for sustaining a contralateral hip fracture; a fracture in history was not. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.},

The research literature has been more prolific on lower-limb devices: a main reason is that they address a basic but fundamental motion task, walking. Leg exoskeletons are simpler to design, compared to upper-limb counterparts, but still have particular cognitive and physical requirements from the emerging human-robot interaction systems. In the state of the art, different control strategies and approaches can be easily found: it is still a challenge to develop an assistive strategy which makes the exoskeleton supply efficient and natural assistance. So, this paper aims to provide a systematic overview of the assistive strategies utilized by active locomotion-augmentation orthoses and exoskeletons. Based on the literature collected from Web of Science and Scopus, we have studied the main robotic devices with a focus on the way they are controlled to deliver assistance; the relevant validations are as well investigated, in particular experimentations with human in the loop. Finally current trends and major challenges in the development of an assistive strategy are concluded and discussed. [All rights reserved Elsevier].},

abstract = {The contradiction between self-weight and load capacity of a power-assisted upper-limb exoskeleton for material hanging is unresolved. In this paper, a non-anthropomorphic 3-degree of freedom (DOF) upper-limb exoskeleton with an internally rotated elbow joint is proposed based on an anthropomorphic 5-DOF upper-limb exoskeleton for power-assisted activity. The proposed 3-DOF upper-limb exoskeleton contains a 2-DOF shoulder joint and a 1-DOF internally rotated elbow joint. The structural parameters of the 3-DOF upper-limb exoskeleton were determined, and the differences and singularities of the two exoskeletons were analyzed. The workspace, the joint torques and the power consumption of two exoskeletons were analyzed by kinematics and dynamics, and an exoskeleton prototype experiment was performed. The results showed that, compared with a typical anthropomorphic upper-limb exoskeleton, the non-anthropomorphic 3-DOF upper-limb exoskeleton had the same actual workspace; eliminated singularities within the workspace; improved the elbow joint force situation; and the maximum elbow joint torque, elbow external-flexion/internal-extension and shoulder flexion/extension power consumption were significantly reduced. The proposed non-anthropomorphic 3-DOF upper-limb exoskeleton can be applied to a power-assisted upper-limb exoskeleton in industrial settings.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This contribution is concerned with joint angle calculation based on inertial measurement data in the context of human motion analysis. Unlike most robotic devices, the human body lacks even surfaces and right angles. Therefore, we focus on methods that avoid assuming certain orientations in which the sensors are mounted with respect to the body segments. After a review of available methods that may cope with this challenge, we present a set of new methods for: (1) joint axis and position identification; and (2) flexion/extension joint angle measurement. In particular, we propose methods that use only gyroscopes and accelerometers and, therefore, do not rely on a homogeneous magnetic field. We provide results from gait trials of a transfemoral amputee in which we compare the inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based methods to an optical 3D motion capture system. Unlike most authors, we place the optical markers on anatomical landmarks instead of attaching them to the IMUs. Root mean square errors of the knee flexion/extension angles are found to be less than 1° on the prosthesis and about 3° on the human leg. For the plantar/dorsiflexion of the ankle, both deviations are about 1°. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Soft tissue specimens are compressed between the object plate of an electronic balance and a linearly actuated indenter with a small rounded tip. The hardware of the device was designed such that a deformation model for semi-infinite media is applicable for calculating the Young's modulus of test specimens from their collected force-displacement data. Force-elongation measurements were performed on long strips of cured silicone mixtures to produce calibrated, tissue-mimicking test samples for the TE in a Young's modulus range of 10-400 kPa. When tested with the TE, the Young's moduli of the silicone samples demonstrated accuracy to within 1-10{\%} of their calibrated values. Testing on excised tissue samples (fresh store-bought poultry breast; bovine liver, kidneys, hind shanks; porcine) was also performed, and a repeatability of elasticity measurements was demonstrated in the range of 8-14{\%}. Results indicate that the TE can be effectively used in laboratory and clinical environments to evaluate the elasticity modulus of tissues.},

abstract = {Knowledge of human-exoskeleton interaction forces is crucial to assess user comfort and effectiveness of the interaction. The subject-exoskeleton collaborative movement and its interaction forces can be predicted in silico using computational modeling techniques. We developed an optimal control framework that consisted of three phases. First, the foot-ground (Phase A) and the subject-exoskeleton (Phase B) contact models were calibrated using three experimental sit-to-stand trials. Then, the collaborative movement and the subject-exoskeleton interaction forces, of six different sit-to-stand trials were predicted (Phase C). The results show that the contact models were able to reproduce experimental kinematics of calibration trials (mean root mean square differences - RMSD - coordinates ≤ 1.1° and velocities ≤ 6.8°/s), ground reaction forces (mean RMSD≤ 22.9 N), as well as the interaction forces at the pelvis, thigh, and shank (mean RMSD ≤ 5.4 N). Phase C could predict the collaborative movements of prediction trials (mean RMSD coordinates ≤ 3.5° and velocities ≤ 15.0°/s), and their subject-exoskeleton interaction forces (mean RMSD ≤ 13.1° N). In conclusion, this optimal control framework could be used while designing exoskeletons to have in silico knowledge of new optimal movements and their interaction forces.},

Nonetheless, the consistency of dynamics calculations from different musculoskeletal simulation packages is not well understood. The objective of this study was to understand the effect of the simulation solver and simulation model on the musculoskeletal simulation results using lower limb models in OpenSim and AnyBody modeling system. Matched musculoskeletal model and generic model in both systems were simulated using the external forces and joint kinematics measured at the Fourth and Sixth Grand Challenge Competitions to Predict In-Vivo Knee Loads. Muscle activation levels in lower limb were compared between the packages, and against the electromyography signals from the aforementioned competitions. The muscle activation levels were very similar between the two packages when matched models were simulated, indicating high consistency between the solvers. In the generic models, the root mean square (RMS) difference in the muscle activation levels was high at 0.15 and 0.19 for ideal force generator muscles and modified Hill-type muscles, respectively. The RMS and phase differences were high between the muscle activations and electromyography signals. Comparisons will help understand the similarities and differences between the musculoskeletal simulation packages and the effects of the model differences on simulation results.},

abstract = {Robotically assisted rehabilitation therapy, which is therapy performed using a robotic device that guides or assists motion and in some cases triggered by a biological signal (such as a myoelectric signal or brain signal) is effective in recovering motor function following impairment. In the field of rehabilitation robots and human support robot, exoskeleton robots have been widely studied both for upper and lower limbs. Applying the exoskeleton to a wrist joint remains challenging because the wrist has two degrees of freedom in a structure smaller than the structures of other upper and lower limb joints and the center of rotation moves according to motion owing to the complex anatomical structure. To tackle this problem, we developed a wrist exoskeleton mechanism that consists of two elastic elements that largely deform during motion in transmitting forces from two linear actuators implemented on the user's forearm and in transforming the forces to wrist flexion/extension and adduction/abduction. The advantages of the presented device are the device's compactness, low weight, and inherent flexibility due to the elastic structure. The present letter presents an overview of the newly developed wrist exoskeleton mechanism, prototype implementation, and preliminary mechanical evaluations. The technical verification of the exoskeleton revealed the feasibility of generating forces that can generate wrist flexion/extension and adduction/abduction movements.},

abstract = {Background: Carotid atherosclerosis may be associated with cognitive decline in elderly stroke-free non-demented individuals. However the studies are few, especially amongst adults in midlife. Rarely was socioeconomic status adequately accounted for. Methods: In a cross-sectional examination of the population-based Jerusalem Lipid Research Clinic (LRC) cohort, carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), plaque and volumetric flow were determined by ultrasound in 507 cohort members, aged 48-52. At the same visit, global cognitive function and its five specific component domains were assessed with a NeuroTrax computerised test battery. Multivariable linear regression and logistic models were applied. Results: In sex-adjusted, but not in multivariable-adjusted linear regression models, IMT and plaque were significantly inversely associated with measures of cognition. However, in binary logistic models adjusted for sex, age, education, childhood and adult SES, and multiple cardiovascular risk factors, IMT was associated with low-ranked (lowest fifth) global cognition (OR per 0.1mm, 1.25, 95{\%}CI 1.01-1.55, p = 0.044); this association was confirmed in multinomial logistic modelling. The presence of atheromatous plaque was associated with elevated risk for low-ranked global cognitive function in midlife (OR, 1.93, 95{\%}CI, 1.04-3.59, p = 0.037). Common carotid volumetric flow was not associated with cognitive function, and adjustment for volumetric flow did not materially affect the associations of IMT or plaque with global cognition. Conclusion: In this population-based cohort in midlife, subclinical carotid atherosclerosis measured as higher IMT and the presence of atherosclerotic plaque was associated with low-ranked global cognitive function. In light of the absence of an independent association of carotid volumetric flow with cognition, and although reverse causation cannot be excluded in this cross-sectional study, we infer that carotid atherosclerosis in midlife may be a marker of intracranial atherosclerosis and possible resulting lower cognitive function.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a soft wearable robot for the shoulder which has the potential to assist individuals suffering from a range of neuromuscular conditions affecting the shoulder to perform activities of daily living. This wearable robot combines two types of soft textile pneumatic actuators which were custom developed for this particular application to support the upper arm through shoulder abduction and horizontal flexion/extension. The advantage of a textile-based approach is that the robot can be lightweight, low-profile, comfortable and non-restrictive to the wearer, and easy to don like an item of clothing. The actuator's ability to fold flat when not in use allows the robot to be almost invisible under clothing, potentially allowing the user to avoid any stigma associated with using assistive devices in public. To abduct the arm, a textilebased pneumatic actuator was developed to fit within the axilla to push the arm upwards, while a pair of smaller actuators pivot the abduction actuator to allow for horizontal extension and flexion. The individual textile actuators were experimentally evaluated before being integrated into a wearable garment. Human subject testing was performed to evaluate the ability of the robot to assist the arm by monitoring changes in biological muscle activity when comparing the robot powered on and off. Preliminary results show large reductions in muscular effort in targeted muscles, demonstrating the feasibility and promise of such a soft wearable robot for the shoulder.},

For characterizing the effects of thermal treatment on the organ and understanding the physical and mechanical processes during this procedure, the temperature-dependent mechanical properties of biological tissues are required. We investigated measurements on whole porcine livers ex vivo using an indentation system. The tests were performed at constant processing conditions after tempering the organ at various temperatures (from 40°C to 90°C) as well as at varying stress conditions of loading velocity, tip shape, and radius on untempered tissues. The force-strain behavior under dynamic loading and subsequent unloading were analyzed for all tests, to characterize the material parameters such as stiffness, strain energy, and force level at maximum strain. The current work shows the velocity-, shape-, and temperature-dependent material properties of porcine livers. Furthermore, the plastic behavior of the organ increases significantly at temperatures above 60°C, reflecting the temperature-sensitive biomechanical and physical properties.},

abstract = {The field of wearable robotics is gaining momentum thanks to its potential application in rehabilitation engineering, assistive robotics, and power augmentation. These devices are designed to be used in direct contact with the user to aid with movement or increase the power of specific skeletal joints. The design of the so-called physical human-robot interface is critical, since it determines not only the efficacy of the robot but the kinematic compatibility of the device with the human skeleton and the degree of adaptation to different anthropometries as well. Failing to deal with these problems causes misalignments between the robot and the user joint. Axes misalignment leads to the impossibility of controlling the torque effectively transmitted to the user joint and causes undesired loading forces on articulations and soft tissues. In this paper, we propose a general analytical method for the design of exoskeletons able to assist human joints without being subjected to misalignment effects. This method is based on a kinetostatic analysis of a coupled mechanism (robot-human skeleton) and can be applied in the design of self-aligning mechanisms. The method is exemplified in the design of an assistive robotic chain for a two-degree-of-freedom (DOF) human articulation.},

abstract = {The paper introduces an active variable stiffness exoskeleton robotic system (AVSER) with the active variable stiffness elastic actuator (AVSEA), which improves the safety for human-robot interaction and produces unique adjustable stiffness capacity to meet the demand for safe active-passive elbow rehabilitation. The AVSEA consists of two DC-motors. One is used to control the position of the joint, and the other is used to adjust the stiffness of the system. The stiffness is generated by a leaf spring. By shortening the effective length of the leaf spring, the AVSEA is able to reduce the stiffness automatically, which makes the AVSER from active (assistive) motion to passive (resistance) rehabilitation during the process of therapy. In the paper, the mechanical design, modeling, and control algorithms are described in details. The capacity of the proposed AVSER with electromyogram (EMG) signal feedback is verified by rehabilitation exercise experiments for the subject to demonstrate the efficacy of the developed system.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been a growing interest in moving away from traditional rigid exoskeletons towards soft exosuits that can provide a variety of advantages including a reduction in both the weight carried by the wearer and the inertia experienced as the wearer flexes and extends their joints. These advantages are achieved by using structured functional textiles in combination with a flexible actuation scheme that enables assistive torques to be applied to the biological joints. Understanding the human-suit interface in these systems is important, as one of the key challenges with this approach is applying force to the human body in a manner that is safe, comfortable, and effective. This paper outlines a methodology for characterizing the structured functional textile of soft exosuits and then uses that methodology to evaluate several factors that lead to different suit-human series stiffnesses and pressure distributions over the body. These factors include the size of the force distribution area and the composition of the structured functional textile. Following the test results, design guidelines are suggested to maximize the safety, comfort, and efficiency of the exosuit.},

abstract = {In this article, a method of multi-connection load compensation and load information calculation for an upper-limb exoskeleton is proposed based on a six-axis force/torque sensor installed between the exoskeleton and the end effector. The proposed load compensation method uses a mounted sensor to measure the force and torque between the exoskeleton and load of different connections and adds a compensator to the controller to compensate the component caused by the load in the human–robot interaction force, so that the human–robot interaction force is only used to operate the exoskeleton. Therefore, the operator can manipulate the exoskeleton with the same interaction force to lift loads of different weights with a passive or fixed connection, and the human–robot interaction force is minimized. Moreover, the proposed load information calculation method can calculate the weight of the load and the position of its center of gravity relative to the exoskeleton and end effector accurately, which is necessary for acquiring the upper-limb exoskeleton center of gravity and stability control of whole-body exoskeleton. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we performed load handling and operational stability experiments. The experimental results showed that the proposed method realized the expected function.},

abstract = {Stroke is the primary cause of permanent impairment and neurological damage in the United States and Europe. Annually, about fifteen million individuals worldwide suffer from stroke, which kills about one third of them. For many years, it was believed that major recovery can be achieved only in the first six months after a stroke. More recent research has demonstrated that even many years after a stroke, significant improvement is not out of reach. However, economic pressures, the aging population, and lack of specialists and available human resources can interrupt therapy, which impedes full recovery of patients after being discharged from hospital following initial rehabilitation. Robotic devices, and in particular portable robots that provide rehabilitation therapy at home and in clinics, are a novel way not only to optimize the cost of therapy but also to let more patients benefit from rehabilitation for a longer time. Robots used for such purposes should be smaller, lighter and more affordable than the robots currently used in clinics and hospitals. The common human-machine interaction design criteria such as work envelopes, safety, comfort, adaptability, space limitations, and weight-to-force ratio must still be taken into consideration. In this work a light, wearable, affordable assistive robot was designed and a controller to assist with an activity of daily life (ADL) was developed. The mechanical design targeted the most vulnerable group of the society to stroke, based on the average size and age of the patients, with adjustability to accommodate a variety of individuals. The novel mechanical design avoids motion singularities and provides a large workspace for various ADLs. Unlike similar exoskeleton robots, the actuators are placed on the patient's torso and the force is transmitted through a Bowden cable mechanism. Since the actuators' mass does not affect the motion of the upper extremities, the robot can be more agile and more powerful. A compact novel actuation method with high power-to-weight ratio called the twisted string actuation method was used. Part of the research involved selection and testing of several string compositions and configurations to compare their suitability and to characterize their performance. Feedback sensor count and type have been carefully considered to keep the cost of the system as low as possible. A master-slave controller was designed and its performance in tracking the targeted ADL trajectory was evaluated for one degree of freedom (DOF). An outline for proposed future research will be presented.},

abstract = {In recent years, microelectromechanical system (MEMS) inertial sensors (3D accelerometers and 3D gyroscopes) have become widely available due to their small size and low cost. Inertial sensor measurements are obtained at high sampling rates and can be integrated to obtain position and orientation information. These estimates are accurate on a short time scale, but suffer from integration drift over longer time scales. To overcome this issue, inertial sensors are typically combined with additional sensors and models. In this tutorial we focus on the signal processing aspects of position and orientation estimation using inertial sensors. We discuss different modeling choices and a selected number of important algorithms. The algorithms include optimization-based smoothing and filtering as well as computationally cheaper extended Kalman filter and complementary filter implementations. The quality of their estimates is illustrated using both experimental and simulated data.},

abstract = {For safe human-robot interaction, the robots, especially exoskeletons, should be transparent for the user, in a way that the user does not feel their weight. In robot-assisted orthopedic rehabilitation, where patients are often sensitive to pain and often not able to lift affected limbs by themselves, this requirement is of crucial importance. To allow patients directly after surgical intervention to participate actively, not only the weight of the robot, but also the weight of the patient's extremity must be compensated. Several assistive acting soft robotic rehabilitation devices have been developed for upper and lower extremities based on pneumatic actuators with rotary elastic chambers (REC-actuators), well suitable for human-robot interaction because of natural inherent compliance. The essential basis for developed adaptive model-based assistive control strategies, in order to provide robot transparency as well as take into account patient's behavior, effort and abilities, and support patients with high voluntary effort, are separated models of soft-robots and of individual patient's extremities. This paper presents an approach to estimate unknown mass parameters of soft robotic rehabilitation devices as well as of individual human's extremities, using a minimal number of experimental measurements as well as specific characteristics of pneumatic REC-actuators without the use of torque sensors. An experimental study shows the influence of using the models based on estimated parameters during control, using a four DoF soft-robot as well as a prototype of an assistive elbow trainer with an unimpaired subject, as first part of a upper extremity rehabilitation robot.},

abstract = {By analysing the dynamic principles of the human gait, an economic gait-control analysis is performed, and passive elements are included to increase the energy efficiency in the motion control of active orthoses. Traditional orthoses use position patterns from the clinical gait analyses (CGAs) of healthy people, which are then de-normalized and adjusted to each user. These orthoses maintain a very rigid gait, and their energy cost is very high, reducing the autonomy of the user. First, to take advantage of the inherent dynamics of the legs, a state machine pattern with different gains in each state is applied to reduce the actuator energy consumption. Next, different passive elements, such as springs and brakes in the joints, are analysed to further reduce energy consumption. After an off-line parameter optimization and a heuristic improvement with genetic algorithms, a reduction in energy consumption of 16.8{\%} is obtained by applying a state machine control pattern, and a reduction of 18.9{\%} is obtained by using passive elements. Finally, by combining both strategies, a more natural gait is obtained, and energy consumption is reduced by 24.6{\%} compared with a pure CGA pattern. {\textcopyright} 2012 Sanz-Merodio et al.; licensee InTech.},

abstract = {Exoskeletons are increasingly used in rehabilitation and daily life in patients with motor disorders after neurological injuries. In this paper, a realistic human knee exoskeleton model based on a physical system was generated, a human–machine system was created in a musculoskeletal modeling software, and human–machine interactions based on different assistive strategies were simulated. The developed human–machine system makes it possible to compute torques, muscle impulse, contact forces, and interactive forces involved in simulated movements. Assistive strategies modeled as a rotational actuator, a simple pendulum model, and a damped pendulum model were applied to the knee exoskeleton during simulated normal and fast gait. We found that the rotational actuator–based assistive controller could reduce the user's required physiological knee extensor torque and muscle impulse by a small amount, which suggests that joint rotational direction should be considered when developing an assistive strategy. Compared to the simple pendulum model, the damped pendulum model based controller made little difference during swing, but further decreased the user's required knee flexor torque during late stance. The trade-off that we identified between interaction forces and physiological torque, of which muscle impulse is the main contributor, should be considered when designing controllers for a physical exoskeleton system. Detailed information at joint and muscle levels provided in this human–machine system can contribute to the controller design optimization of assistive exoskeletons for rehabilitation and movement assistance.},

abstract = {Muscle fatigue has multiple definitions, but with a special mission what is the protective mission, warning the body about weakness or the appearance of a functional disability. In this review, we present the applications of Electromyography (EMG) as a technique to gain insight into the activation patterns during cycling and the onset of fatigue. A narrative review has been carried out in which analysis of the EMG activity during the different phases of the pedal cycle. The movement of the pedal has been studied exhaustively and has been able to distinguish 4 phases in the pedaling that originate the propulsion and the recovery. By using the EMG it is possible to describe the typical activation patterns in terms of the activity level and activation time of the main muscles of the lower limbs. Muscle activity and coordination can vary between people throughout a single cycle of pedaling and between different cycles of the same person. Moreover, we examine the main factors that can influence these electromyographic patterns during the pedal cycle. We also describe the influence of factors such as output power, cadence or frequency of pedaling, slope and posture, foot pedal interface, training level and muscle fatigue that produce alterations in the time of activation and muscular coordination. In conclusion, we believe that EMG can detect the occurrence of muscle fatigue, either of central or peripheral origin. The method used to estimate the neuromuscular fatigue threshold from the EMG amplitude during an incremental test on a cycle ergometer is presented. In general there is an increase in amplitude to try to maintain the force and a decrease in the frequency spectrum.},

It shows improved performances in terms of finger motion measurement and force feedback compared with existing systems such as finger joint angle calculation and precise force control. Intensive experiments are also conducted to verify the mechanical performance as a haptic interface. The finger joint angles are inversely calculated by an estimation algorithm based on the fingertip positions with only one calibration posture. Not only the index finger motion which is generally measured, but also the thumb motion is accurately measured by our proposed algorithm. Accurate force feedback is achieved by robust control of the motor current. The motion measurement accuracy of average 2.62∘ errors in the thumb and index finger was verified by an infrared motion capture system. For performance evaluation of the force control, a Z-width and various interaction experiments were conducted; variable stiffness were generated, and various sizes {\&} shapes of virtual objects were identified.},

abstract = {Background: Odanacatib, a cathepsin K inhibitor, reduces bone resorption while maintaining bone formation. Previous work has shown that odanacatib increases bone mineral density in postmenopausal women with low bone mass. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of odanacatib to reduce fracture risk in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Methods: The Long-term Odanacatib Fracture Trial (LOFT) was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven study at 388 outpatient clinics in 40 countries. Eligible participants were women aged at least 65 years who were postmenopausal for 5 years or more, with a femoral neck or total hip bone mineral density T-score between −2{\textperiodcentered}5 and −4{\textperiodcentered}0 if no previous radiographic vertebral fracture, or between −1{\textperiodcentered}5 and −4{\textperiodcentered}0 with a previous vertebral fracture. Women with a previous hip fracture, more than one vertebral fracture, or a T-score of less than −4{\textperiodcentered}0 at the total hip or femoral neck were not eligible unless they were unable or unwilling to use approved osteoporosis treatment. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either oral odanacatib (50 mg once per week) or matching placebo. Randomisation was done using an interactive voice recognition system after stratification for previous radiographic vertebral fracture, and treatment was masked to study participants, investigators and their staff, and sponsor personnel. If the study completed before 5 years of double-blind treatment, consenting participants could enrol in a double-blind extension study (LOFT Extension), continuing their original treatment assignment for up to 5 years from randomisation. Primary endpoints were incidence of vertebral fractures as assessed using radiographs collected at baseline, 6 and 12 months, yearly, and at final study visit in participants for whom evaluable radiograph images were available at baseline and at least one other timepoint, and hip and non-vertebral fractures adjudicated as being a result of osteoporosis as assessed by clinical history and radiograph. Safety was assessed in participants who received at least one dose of study drug. The adjudicated cardiovascular safety endpoints were a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke, and new-onset atrial fibrillation or flutter. Individual cardiovascular endpoints and death were also assessed. LOFT and LOFT Extension are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT00529373) and the European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT number 2007-002693-66). Findings: Between Sept 14, 2007, and Nov 17, 2009, we randomly assigned 16 071 evaluable patients to treatment: 8043 to odanacatib and 8028 to placebo. After a median follow-up of 36{\textperiodcentered}5 months (IQR 34{\textperiodcentered}43–40{\textperiodcentered}15) 4297 women assigned to odanacatib and 3960 assigned to placebo enrolled in LOFT Extension (total median follow-up 47{\textperiodcentered}6 months, IQR 35{\textperiodcentered}45–60{\textperiodcentered}06). In LOFT, cumulative incidence of primary outcomes for odanacatib versus placebo were: radiographic vertebral fractures 3{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} (251/6770) versus 7{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (542/6910), hazard ratio (HR) 0{\textperiodcentered}46, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}40–0{\textperiodcentered}53; hip fractures 0{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (65/8043) versus 1{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} (125/8028), 0{\textperiodcentered}53, 0{\textperiodcentered}39–0{\textperiodcentered}71; non-vertebral fractures 5{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} (412/8043) versus 6{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} (541/8028), 0{\textperiodcentered}77, 0{\textperiodcentered}68–0{\textperiodcentered}87; all p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001. Combined results from LOFT plus LOFT Extension for cumulative incidence of primary outcomes for odanacatib versus placebo were: radiographic vertebral fractures 4{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} (341/6909) versus 9{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} (675/7011), HR 0{\textperiodcentered}48, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}42–0{\textperiodcentered}55; hip fractures 1{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} (86/8043) versus 2{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} (162/8028), 0{\textperiodcentered}52, 0{\textperiodcentered}40–0{\textperiodcentered}67; non-vertebral fractures 6{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (512/8043) versus 8{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (675/8028), 0{\textperiodcentered}74, 0{\textperiodcentered}66–0{\textperiodcentered}83; all p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001. In LOFT, the composite cardiovascular endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke occurred in 273 (3{\textperiodcentered}4{\%}) of 8043 patients in the odanacatib group versus 245 (3{\textperiodcentered}1{\%}) of 8028 in the placebo group (HR 1{\textperiodcentered}12, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}95–1{\textperiodcentered}34; p=0{\textperiodcentered}18). New-onset atrial fibrillation or flutter occurred in 112 (1{\textperiodcentered}4{\%}) of 8043 patients in the odanacatib group versus 96 (1{\textperiodcentered}2{\%}) of 8028 in the placebo group (HR 1{\textperiodcentered}18, 0{\textperiodcentered}90–1{\textperiodcentered}55; p=0{\textperiodcentered}24). Odanacatib was associated with an increased risk of stroke (1{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} [136/8043] vs 1{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} [104/8028], HR 1{\textperiodcentered}32, 1{\textperiodcentered}02–1{\textperiodcentered}70; p=0{\textperiodcentered}034), but not myocardial infarction (0{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} [60/8043] vs 0{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} [74/8028], HR 0{\textperiodcentered}82, 0{\textperiodcentered}58–1{\textperiodcentered}15; p=0{\textperiodcentered}26). The HR for all-cause mortality was 1{\textperiodcentered}13 (5{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} [401/8043] vs 4{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} [356/8028], 0{\textperiodcentered}98–1{\textperiodcentered}30; p=0{\textperiodcentered}10). When data from LOFT Extension were included, the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke occurred in significantly more patients in the odanacatib group than in the placebo group (401 [5{\textperiodcentered}0{\%}] of 8043 vs 343 [4{\textperiodcentered}3{\%}] of 8028, HR 1{\textperiodcentered}17, 1{\textperiodcentered}02–1{\textperiodcentered}36; p=0{\textperiodcentered}029, as did stroke (2{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} [187/8043] vs 1{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} [137/8028], HR 1{\textperiodcentered}37, 1{\textperiodcentered}10–1{\textperiodcentered}71; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0051). Interpretation: Odanacatib reduced the risk of fracture, but was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, specifically stroke, in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Based on the overall balance between benefit and risk, the study's sponsor decided that they would no longer pursue development of odanacatib for treatment of osteoporosis.

abstract = {A lower limb rehabilitation robot, namely iLeg, has been developed recently. Since active exercises have been proven to be effective for neurorehabilitation and motor recov- ery, they are suggested to be implemented on iLeg. To this goal, patients' motion intention should be recognized. Therefore, a method based on the dynamic model of the human-robot interface (HRI) is designed to recognize the human motion intention. This paper is devoted to modeling and identifying the dynamics of the HRI. Firstly, the dynamic model of the HRI is designed by combining the dynamic models of the human leg and iLeg, where the human leg dynamic model (HLDM) is mainly concerned. By considering the motion trajectories during the rehabilitation exercises provided by iLeg, the human leg can be taken as a manipulator with two degrees of freedom; meanwhile, the joint angles and torques of the human leg can be measured indirectly by using the position and torque sensors mounted on the joints of iLeg. As a result, an 8- parameter HLDM can be designed by using the Lagrangian method. Then, the dynamic model of the HRI is identified by respectively and independently identifying the undetermined dynamic parameters of iLeg and the HLDM, where the dynamic parameters of the HLDM are mainly considered. Finally, the feasibility of the dynamic model of the HRI is validated by experiments.},

abstract = {Objectives: To document the frequency of skin problems among lower-limb prosthesis users and to assess for factors associated with skin problems among patients using a prosthesis. Design: Six-year retrospective chart review. Setting: An outpatient amputee clinic at a regional, referral rehabilitation hospital in Canada. Participants: Seven hundred forty-five subjects with a total of 828 lower-extremity amputations participated. Subjects were included if they had a lower-extremity amputation and used a prosthesis for ambulation or transfers. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: The presence or absence of a skin problem. Descriptive and nonparametric statistics were used to analyze data. Results: Three hundred thirty-seven residual limbs (40.7{\%}) had at least 1 skin problem. Adjusted odds ratios showed that amputation level, being employed, type of walking aid, and absence of peripheral vascular disease (as a comorbidity) were independently associated with the presence of at least 1 skin problem (P{\textless}.05). Conclusions: Dermatologic conditions are a frequent complication for the lower-extremity amputee who uses a prosthesis. The results suggest that more active amputees have an increased risk for developing skin problems. Further study in this area is warranted. {\textcopyright} 2005 by American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.},

abstract = {Standard clinical gait analysis protocols usually limit to test self-selected speed gait: this approach is generally valid and permits time and cost saving. Yet, the literature evidences suggest that some pathologies (especially at onset or subclinical level) may not primarily affect plain gait, but more demanding locomotor tasks. In the present study we therefore propose a multiple-task gait analysis protocol including: self-selected, increased and decreased speed gait; walking on toes; walking on heels; step ascending and step descending, and apply it to 40 healthy subjects (20 aged 6-17, 20 aged 22-72) thus building extensive reference data set. Published studies already report normative data for some of these tasks, but inhomogeneously (due to different collecting methods and biomechanical models, population characteristics, nature of data). We verify a good correlation between our results and those presented by Schwartz et al. (2008) [12] in their study providing extensive data on the effect of walking speed on the gait of healthy children. In discussing the results, the rationale and effectiveness of each task is confirmed, and we supply an electronic addendum with comprehensive kinematic, kinetic and electromyographic normative data for the considered population, along with a set of reference parameters and related statistical analysis, as a premise for further applications on pathological subjects. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The first principle, called the Proximity Compatibility Prin- ciple, specifies that displays relevant to a common task or mental operation should be rendered close together in perceptual space. The second principle, called the Control-Display Compatibility Principle, stipulates that the spatial arrangement and manipulation of controls should be easily distinguishable. To examine the utility of both principles, the authors conducted an experiment comparing the ability of subjects to find effective designs using a separable versus a configural interface in a multi-objective engineering design task. Results suggest that the proximity compat- ibility principle is an effective indicator of task performance. Moreover, the control-display com- patibility principle can be used as an indicator of performance efficiency.},

To overcome the basic concept of the muscle suit, the armor-type muscle suit is proposed and the abduction motion is realized. However, because of the difficulty in implementing all motion for the upper limb by the armor-type muscle suit, the new structure with the mechanical joints and hard frame is applied and all motion is achieved.},

abstract = {When developing robotic exoskeletons, the design of physical connections between the device and the human limb to which it is connected is a crucial problem. Indeed, using an embedment at each connection point leads to uncontrollable forces at the interaction port, induced by hyperstaticity. In practice, these forces may be large because in general the human limb kinematics and the exoskeleton kinematics differ. To cope with hyperstaticity, the literature suggests the addition of passive mechanisms inside the mechanism loops. However, empirical solutions that are proposed so far lack proper analysis and generality. In this paper, we study the general problem of connecting two similar kinematic chains through multiple passive mechanisms. We derive a constructive method that allows the determination of all the possible distributions of freed degrees of freedom across different fixation mechanisms. It also provides formal proofs of global isostaticity. Practical usefulness is illustrated through two examples with conclusive experimental results: a preliminary study made on a manikin with an arm exoskeleton controlling the movement (passive mode) and a larger campaign on ten healthy subjects performing pointing tasks with a transparent robot (active mode).

abstract = {In recent years, the robotic research area has become extremely prolific in terms of wearable active exoskeletons for human body motion assistance, with the presentation of many novel devices, for upper limbs, lower limbs, and the hand. The hand shows a complex morphology, a high intersubject variability, and offers limited space for physical interaction with a robot: as a result, hand exoskeletons usually are heavy, cumbersome, and poorly usable. This paper introduces a novel device designed on the basis of human kinematic compatibility, wearability, and portability criteria. This hand exoskeleton, briefly HX, embeds several features as underactuated joints, passive degrees of freedom ensuring adaptability and compliance toward the hand anthropometric variability, and an ad hoc design of self-alignment mechanisms to absorb human/robot joint axes misplacement, and proposes a novel mechanism for the thumb opposition. The HX kinematic design and actuation are discussed together with theoretical and experimental data validating its adaptability performances. Results suggest that HX matches the self-alignment design goal and is then suited for close human-robot interaction.},

abstract = {We examined the metabolic cost of plantar flexor muscle-tendon mechanical work during human walking. Nine healthy subjects walked at constant step frequency on a motorized treadmill at speeds corresponding to 80{\%} (1.00 m s -1), 100{\%} (1.25 m s-1), 120{\%} (1.50 m s-1) and 140{\%} (1.75 m s-1) of their preferred step length (L*) at 1.25 m s-1. In each condition subjects donned robotic ankle exoskeletons on both legs. The exoskeletons were powered by artificial pneumatic muscles and controlled using soleus electromyography (i.e. proportional myoelectric control). We measured subjects' metabolic energy expenditure and exoskeleton mechanics during both unpowered and powered walking to test the hypothesis that ankle plantarflexion requires more net metabolic power (W kg-1) at longer step lengths for a constant step frequency (i.e. preferred at 1.25 m s-1). As step length increased from 0.8 L* to 1.4 L*, exoskeletons delivered ∼25{\%} more average positive mechanical power (P=0.01; +0.20±0.02 W kg-1 to +0.25±0.02 W kg-1, respectively). The exoskeletons reduced net metabolic power by more at longer step lengths (P=0.002; -0.21±0.06 W kg-1 at 0.8 L* and -0.70±0.12 W kg-1 at 1.4 L*). For every 1 J of exoskeleton positive mechanical work subjects saved 0.72 J of metabolic energy ('apparent efficiency'=1.39) at 0.8 L* and 2.6 J of metabolic energy ('apparent efficiency'=0.38) at 1.4 L*. Declining ankle muscle-tendon 'apparent efficiency' suggests an increase in ankle plantar flexor muscle work relative to Achilles' tendon elastic energy recoil during walking with longer steps. However, previously stored elastic energy in Achilles' tendon still probably contributes up to 34{\%} of ankle muscle-tendon positive work even at the longest step lengths we tested. Across the range of step lengths we studied, the human ankle muscle-tendon system performed 34-40{\%} of the total lower-limb positive mechanical work but accounted for only 7-26{\%} of the net metabolic cost of walking.},

abstract = {Objective Hospital-acquired pressure injuries are localised skin injuries that cause significant mortality and are costly. Nursing best practices prevent pressure injuries, including time-consuming, complex tasks that lack payment incentives. The Braden Scale is an evidence-based stratification tool nurses use daily to assess pressure-injury risk. Our objective was to analyse the cost-utility of performing repeated risk-assessment for pressure-injury prevention in all patients or high-risk groups. Design Cost-utility analysis using Markov modelling from US societal and healthcare sector perspectives within a 1-year time horizon. Setting Patient-level longitudinal data on 34 787 encounters from an academic hospital electronic health record (EHR) between 2011 and 2014, including daily Braden scores. Supervised machine learning simulated age-adjusted transition probabilities between risk levels and pressure injuries. Participants Hospitalised adults with Braden scores classified into five risk levels: very high risk (6-9), high risk (10-11), moderate risk (12-14), at-risk (15-18), minimal risk (19-23). Interventions Standard care, repeated risk assessment in all risk levels or only repeated risk assessment in high-risk strata based on machine-learning simulations. Main outcome measures Costs (2016 {\$}US) of pressure-injury treatment and prevention, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) related to pressure injuries were weighted by transition probabilities to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) at {\$}100 000/QALY willingness-to-pay. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses tested model uncertainty. Results Simulating prevention for all patients yielded greater QALYs at higher cost from societal and healthcare sector perspectives, equating to ICERs of {\$}2000/QALY and {\$}2142/QALY, respectively. Risk-stratified follow-up in patients with Braden scores {\textless}15 dominated standard care. Prevention for all patients was cost-effective in {\textgreater}99{\%}of probabilistic simulations.conclusion Our analysis using EHR data maintains that pressure-injury prevention for all inpatients is cost-effective. Hospitals should invest in nursing compliance with international prevention guidelines.},

Within the active one, a human-exoskeleton interaction approach is proposed. It allows us to provide a knee joint torque support, adapted according to the intention and ability of the wearer, for assistance-as-needed. The wearer's intention is estimated using a realistic model of the muscles actuating the knee joint. The identification process concerns the inertial parameters of the shank-foot-exoskeleton and the musculotendinous parameters. Experiments were conducted online on a healthy subject and have shown satisfactory results in terms of tracking error, intention detection and passive-rehabilitation/active-assistance.

Quercus, followed by Corylus avellana, Fagus sylvatica, Ilex aquifolium, Taxus baccata and Ulmus. Acer, Alnus and Maloideae occur in very low numbers. The high percentages of Fraxinus are possibly result from the selection of ash for fodder. Evidence for the use of crops (Hordeum vulgare, Triticum aestivum/durum) comes only from the Chalcolithic contexts. The identification of acorns in one Chalcolithic hearth shows that roasting of these nuts was taking place maybe to improve taste and to facilitate further processing or to improve storage conditions. The results show that plant food gathering still played a role within the subsistence of farming human groups in the region.},

Patients while walking with these devices adapt their walking pattern in response to the applied forces. The efficacy of a rehabilitation paradigm thus depends on the human-robot interaction. A cable driven leg exoskeleton (CDLE) use actuated cables to apply external joint torques on human leg. Cables are lightweight and flexible but can only be pulled, thus a CDLE requires redundant cables. Redundancy in CDLE can be utilized to appropriately tune a robot's performance. In this work, we present the stiffness analysis of CDLE. Different stiffness performance indices are established to study the role of system parameters in improving the human-robot interaction.},

Consequently, few robot designs have been proposed by researchers which fall under either of the two categories, namely, wearable robots or platform-based robots. This paper presents a review of both kinds of ankle robots along with a brief analysis of their design, actuation and control approaches. While reviewing these designs it was observed that most of them are undesirably inspired by industrial robot designs. Taking note of the design concerns of current ankle robots, few improvements in the ankle robot designs have also been suggested. Conventional position control or force control approaches, being used in the existing ankle robots, have been reviewed. Apparently, opportunities of improvement also exist in the actuation as well as control of ankle robots. Subsequently, a discussion on most recent research in the development of novel actuators and advanced controllers based on appropriate physical and cognitive human-robot interaction has also been included in this review. {\textcopyright} 2015 Informa UK Ltd.},

The initial third of the article considers: activity and prevention definitions; historical evidence showing physical inactivity is detrimental to health and normal organ functional capacities; cause versus treatment; physical activity and inactivity mechanisms differ; gene-environment interaction (including aerobic training adaptations, personalized medicine, and co-twin physical activity); and specificity of adaptations to type of training. Next, physical activity/exercise is examined as primary prevention against 35 chronic conditions [accelerated biological aging/premature death, low cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max), sarcopenia, metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, hypertension, stroke, congestive heart failure, endothelial dysfunction, arterial dyslipidemia, hemostasis, deep vein thrombosis, cognitive dysfunction, depression and anxiety, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, balance, bone fracture/falls, rheumatoid arthritis, colon cancer, breast cancer, endometrial cancer, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, polycystic ovary syndrome, erectile dysfunction, pain, diverticulitis, constipation, and gallbladder diseases]. The article ends with consideration of deterioration of risk factors in longerterm sedentary groups; clinical consequences of inactive childhood/adolescence; and public policy. In summary, the body rapidly maladapts to insufficient physical activity, and if continued, results in substantial decreases in both total and quality years of life. Taken together, conclusive evidence exists that physical inactivity is one important cause of most chronic diseases. In addition, physical activity primarily prevents, or delays, chronic diseases, implying that chronic disease need not be an inevitable outcome during life. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physiological Society.},

They represent a common problem in the pathology of plegic patients and, plastic surgery has a significant role in their treatment. Pressure sores occur over bony prominences and so, they are most commonly seen at the sacrum and trochanters in paralyzed patients and at ischium for the patients who sit in a wheelchair for a long time. For these patients, surgical treatment is very important because on one hand, it stops the loss of nutrients and proteins at the site of the pressure sore, and on the other hand, it permits the initiation of neuromuscular recuperation treatment much faster.},

abstract = {AbstractObjective Non-invasive neuromuscular characterization aims to provide greater insight into the effectiveness of existing and emerging rehabilitation therapies by quantifying neuromuscular characteristics relating to force production, muscle viscoelasticity and voluntary neural activation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to evaluate neuromuscular characteristics, such as muscle fiber stiffness and viscosity, by combining robotic and HD-sEMG measurements with computational musculoskeletal modeling. This pilot study investigates the efficacy of this approach on a healthy population and provides new insight on potential limitations of conventional musculoskeletal models for this application. Methods Subject-specific neuromuscular characteristics of the biceps and triceps brachii were evaluated using robot-measured kinetics, kinematics and EMG activity as inputs to a musculoskeletal model. Results Repeatability experiments in five participants revealed large variability within each subjects evaluated characteristics, with almost all experiencing variation greater than 50{\%} of full scale when repeating the same task. Conclusion The use of robotics and HD-sEMG, in conjunction with musculoskeletal modeling, to quantify neuromuscular characteristics has been explored. Despite the ability to predict joint kinematics with relatively high accuracy, parameter characterization was inconsistent i.e. many parameter combinations gave rise to minimal kinematic error. Significance: The proposed technique is a novel approach for in vivo neuromuscular characterization and is a step towards the realization of objective in-home robot-assisted rehabilitation. Importantly, the results have confirmed the technical (robot and HD-sEMG) feasibility while highlighting the need to develop new musculoskeletal models and optimization techniques capable of achieving consistent results across a range of dynamic tasks.},

This paper describes the critical design criteria and presents the process of design and calculation of the actuation system. A flexible physical Human-Robot-Interaction (pHRI) measurement device is designed and applied to detect the human movement, which comprises two force sensors and two gasbags attached to the inner surface of the connection cuff. An online adaptive pHRI minimization control strategy is proposed and implemented to drive the robotic exoskeleton system to follow the motion trajectory of human limb. The measured pHRI information is fused by the Variance Weighted Average (VWA) method. The Mean Square Values (MSV) of pHRI and control torque are utilized to evaluate the performance of the exoskeleton. To improve the comfort level and reduce energy consumption, the gravity compensation is taken into consideration when the control law is designed. Finally, practical experiments are performed on healthy users. Experimental results show that the proposed system can assist people to walk and the outlined control strategy is valid and effective.},

abstract = {To understand the effects of soft exosuits on human loaded walking, we developed a reconfigurable multi-joint actuation platform that can provide synchronized forces to the ankle and hip joints. Two different assistive strategies were evaluated on eight subjects walking on a treadmill at a speed of 1.25 m/s with a 23.8 kg backpack: 1) hip extension assistance and 2) multi-joint assistance (hip extension, ankle plantarflexion and hip flexion). Results show that the exosuit introduces minimum changes to kinematics and reduces biological joint moments. A reduction trend in muscular activity was observed for both conditions. On average, the exosuit reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 0.21 +/- 0.04 and 0.67 +/- 0.09 W/kg for hip extension assistance and multi-joint assistance respectively, which is equivalent to an average metabolic reduction of 4.6{\%} and 14.6{\%}, demonstrating that soft exosuits can effectively improve human walking efficiency during load carriage without affecting natural walking gait. Moreover, it indicates that actuating multiple joints with soft exosuits provides a significant benefit to muscular activity and metabolic cost compared to actuating single joint.},

With an inappropriately designed transtibial prostheses socket, the interaction between the socket and the stump occurs, leading to increased friction and subsequent surface damage to the soft tissue. In individual types of transtibial prostheses, locations are defined which can be loaded and which cannot be loaded. On the basis of the study of the anterior side of the stump, three loadable and two non-loadable areas were monitored using the TACTILUS tactile pressure sensor (Sensor Products Inc., Madison, New Jersey, USA). Methods of measuring individual values were proposed for the purpose of sensing the pressure in the socket and the liner interface, the stump and the liner interface. Each method includes the methodological preparation of the patient, the preparation of the room, the preparation of the measuring system, and the subsequent method of data processing. In the submitted paper, 11 stumps were non-invasively monitored. The method of assessing the pressure exerted on the stumps was focused on the monitoring of the pressure distribution in the selected areas. The results obtained by the pressure measurements were statistically processed. In both cases of the pressure system placement, the p-value was higher than 0.05; therefore, we can state that the sets are equal.},

First, a kinematics model for climbing stairs with the step length, walking speed, and direction is developed. Then, the trajectory of the center of gravity (CoG) in both sagittal plane (SP) and coronal plane (CP) of the human-robot system is designed using virtual slope method (VSM) and dual length linear inverted pendulum model (DLLIPM), which are generated in parallel to the gradient vector of the virtual slope and the horizontal plane, respectively. Then, the task workspace of climbing stairs can be divided into a human domination region and a robot assistance region through a novel designed barrier energy function, such that the motion of human's legs can be constrained within a compliant region around the desired trajectories. Moreover, based on a smooth transition between the human and robot regions, an adaptive controller is designed to simultaneously incorporate robot motion and human's capabilities. Actual experiments involving several human subjects have been conducted and its results demonstrate the performance of the control strategy.},

The mechanical behavior of the spleen was molded in detail, including its nonlinear hyper viscoelastic properties using a mass-spring-damper model. A novel collision detection algorithm was used to determine the tool-tissue contact zones. Force-based and geometry-based boundary conditions were imposed at the contact nodes, respectively, to represent slippage-included and slippage-free grasping conditions. The model's predictions were validated against the experimental results on a synthetic test sample. Results of simulation of interactions between the grasping tool and the spleen organ indicated that the non-linear rate dependent and stress relaxation behaviors of the tissue was well depicted by the model. Also, the model was capable of reflecting the effect of tool-tissue friction coefficient on the slippage-free or slippage-included grasping behaviors.},

In this paper we discuss the effect of a performance augmenting exoskeleton on the metabolic cost of an able-bodied user/pilot during periodic squatting. We investigated whether an exoskeleton device will significantly reduce the metabolic cost and what is the influence of the chosen device control strategy. By measuring oxygen consumption, minute ventilation, heart rate, blood oxygenation and muscle EMG during 5 minute squatting series, at one squat every 2 seconds, we show the effects of using a prototype robotic knee exoskeleton under three different noninvasive control approaches: gravity compensation approach, position based approach and a novel oscillator based approach. The latter proposes a novel control which ensures synchronization of the device and the user. Statistically significant decrease in physiological responses can be observed when using the robotic knee exoskeleton under gravity compensation and oscillator based control. On the other hand, the effects of position based control were not significant in all parameters although all approaches significantly reduced the energy expenditure during squatting.},

@article{Aguirre-Ollinger2012,
abstract = {A new method of lower-limb exoskeleton control aimed at improving the agility of leg-swing motion is presented. In the absence of control, an exoskeleton's mechanism usually hinders agility by adding mechanical impedance to the legs. The uncompensated inertia of the exoskeleton will reduce the natural frequency of leg swing, probably leading to lower step frequency during walking as well as increased metabolic energy consumption. The proposed controller emulates inertia compensation by adding a feedback loop consisting of low-pass filtered angular acceleration multiplied by a negative gain. This gain simulates negative inertia in the low-frequency range. The resulting controller combines two assistive effects: increasing the natural frequency of the lower limbs and performing net work per swing cycle. The controller was tested on a statically mounted exoskeleton that assists knee flexion and extension. Subjects performed movement sequences, first unassisted and then using the exoskeleton, in the context of a computer-based task resembling a race. In the exoskeleton's baseline state, the frequency of leg swing and the mean angular velocity were consistently reduced. The addition of inertia compensation enabled subjects to recover their normal frequency and increase their selected angular velocity. The work performed by the exoskeleton was evidenced by catch trials in the protocol. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

The human-centered approach, addressing the problem of physical human–exoskeleton interactions, models and simulates the mechanics for the exoskeleton and the human body in concern. It allows designers to efficiently analyze and evaluate exoskeleton functions. A simulation platform is developed by integrating a musculoskeletal human body and an exoskeleton. An assistive exoskeleton for the symptom of brachial plexus injury is simulated and analyzed. Two types of passive exoskeletons with gravity-compensating capability are evaluated, and the optimal spring stiffnesses are obtained.

abstract = {This paper presents the fabrication, characterization and applications of a 3D-printed instrumented support for wearable devices. Intensity variation-based polymer optical fiber (POF) sensors were employed in the support instrumentation, in order to obtain a low-cost system. In the proposed instrumented support, two POFs are embedded in a 3D-printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) rigid structure for microclimate assessment (without the influence of the applied force). Additionally, other two POFs are embedded in a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) flexible structure for the force assessment, where one sensor measures the applied force in flexion cycles and the other in extension cycles. All four sensors are characterized with respect to temperature and humidity. Both force sensors are also characterized with respect to the force and their cross-sensitivities with respect to the temperature and humidity. The results show the feasibility of the proposed sensor system embedded in the 3D-printed support, where the errors for the force assessment are below 2.8 N, and for temperature and humidity the errors are about 1.1 °C and 2.5{\%}, respectively. The feasibility of the proposed instrumented support in measuring force and microclimate variations was also verified in the application as a shank support for a lower limb exoskeleton for knee rehabilitation and on a passive orthosis for gait assistance.},

abstract = {During impact the relative motion of two bodies is often taken to be simply represented as half of a damped sine wave, according to the Kelvin-Voigt model. This is shown to be logically untenable, for it indicates that the bodies must exert tension on one another just before separating. Furthermore, it denotes that the damping energy loss is proportional to the square of the impacting velocity, instead of to its cube, as can be deduced from Goldsmith's work. A damping term $\lambda$xnx˙ is here introduced; for a sphere impacting a plate Hertz gives n = 3/2. The Kelvin-Voigt model is shown to be approximated as a special case deducible from this law, and applicable when impacts are absent. Physical experiments have confirmed this postulate.},

abstract = {In this paper, a system design and three locomotion control algorithms are proposed for a hydraulic lower extremity exoskeleton to enhance mobility and reduce muscle fatigue caused by backpack loads. The range of motion of the exoskeleton and the capacity of the hydraulic power unit, which generates the hydraulic flow and pressure, are determined by analysing human walking data obtained using a motion capture device and force plates. For movement comfort, the mechanical structure and the joints of the exoskeleton are designed such that the motion of the wearer coincides with that of the exoskeleton. In addition, locomotion control algorithms for stable normal walking are described; these algorithms enable dual-mode control and transition control. Dual-mode control is comprised of an active mode in the stance phase and a passive mode in the swing phase. In the active mode, the exoskeleton is controlled to track the motion of the wearer, and in the passive mode, its active joints work as passive joints by blocking the hydraulic power supply from the hydraulic power unit. Transition control, which consists of a torque-shaping method and a pre-transition algorithm, is adopted to improve locomotion responses during gait phase transition. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the locomotion control algorithms and the developed hydraulic lower limb exoskeleton, walking experiments are performed on a treadmill, at a speed of 4 km/h, while carrying 45 kg backpack loads. The assistance effect of the exoskeleton is also validated by comparing the electromyography (EMG) signals of four selected muscles, with and without the exoskeleton, for single stance and level walking while carrying the same 45 kg backpack loads.},

abstract = {This paper presents an adjustable knee mechanism for walking assistance devices for the elderly to provide physical gait assistance. The adjustable knee mechanism can assist in flexion/extension motions of the knee joint and compensate for the transitional movements of the knee in the sagittal plane as well as aligning the frontal plane. In order to compensate for the center of rotation, the proposed adjustable knee mechanism is implemented by connecting several rolling cams with unique and precisely calculated contact geometries. The key idea of the proposed mechanism is to realize linear motion and accurate torque transmission by a pulley method using the rolling joint in which the distance of the center between the rolling cams is changed. The proposed articulated joint can effectively deliver the torque required for assistance while adapting to the joint motion of the wearer. This paper describes the mechanical design of this knee mechanism and its implementation on a wearable robot and in preliminary experiments. The performance of the proposed mechanism was verified by simulations and experiments.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: An important part of the rehabilitation process using exoskeleton robots has been the creation of a friendly Human Robot Interaction (HRI) system. OBJECTIVE: In order to combine SEMG signal into the HRI system, a SEMG-angle model based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was put forward in this paper. METHODS: Feature extraction as a critical issue of signal preprocessing was handled by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) which realized signal data dimension reduction and solved the common problem of redundant features. A comparison study was given to show the different performance of various EMG-angle model separately based on HMM, Back Propagation (BP) neural network and Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network. RESULTS: The HMM modeling method which with lower calculation complexity can achieve a better modeling performance (average accuracy 93.063{\%}) compared with BP neural network (average accuracy 88.180{\%}) and RBF neural network (average accuracy 88.752{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: SEMG signals have some characteristic properties which is similar to a quasi-stationary filtered white noise stochastic process, the structure of HMMs makes it ideally suited for classification and modeling SEMG signals, and the results of this study show that it can achieve a better performance than the commonly used methods (BP and RBF).},

abstract = {Stroke significantly affects thousands of individuals annually, leading to considerable physical impairment and functional disability. Gait is one of the most important activities of daily living affected in stroke survivors. Recent technological developments in powered robotics exoskeletons can create powerful adjunctive tools for rehabilitation and potentially accelerate functional recovery. Here, we present the development and evaluation of a novel lower limb robotic exoskeleton, namely H2 (Technaid S.L., Spain), for gait rehabilitation in stroke survivors. H2 has six actuated joints and is designed to allow intensive overground gait training. An assistive gait control algorithm was developed to create a force field along a desired trajectory, only applying torque when patients deviate from the prescribed movement pattern. The device was evaluated in 3 hemiparetic stroke patients across 4 weeks of training per individual (approximately 12 sessions). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Houston. The main objective of this initial pre-clinical study was to evaluate the safety and usability of the exoskeleton. A Likert scale was used to measure patient's perception about the easy of use of the device. Three stroke patients completed the study. The training was well tolerated and no adverse events occurred. Early findings demonstrate that H2 appears to be safe and easy to use in the participants of this study. The overground training environment employed as a means to enhance active patient engagement proved to be challenging and exciting for patients. These results are promising and encourage future rehabilitation training with a larger cohort of patients. The developed exoskeleton enables longitudinal overground training of walking in hemiparetic patients after stroke. The system is robust and safe when applied to assist a stroke patient performing an overground walking task. Such device opens the opportunity to study means to optimize a rehabilitation treatment that can be customized for individuals. $\backslash$n                  Trial registration: This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ($\backslash$n                    https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02114450$\backslash$n                    $\backslash$n                  ).},

abstract = {Muscles actuate running by developing forces that propel the body forward while supporting the body's weight. To understand how muscles contribute to propulsion (i.e., forward acceleration of the mass center) and support (i.e., upward acceleration of the mass center) during running we developed a three-dimensional muscle-actuated simulation of the running gait cycle. The simulation is driven by 92 musculotendon actuators of the lower extremities and torso and includes the dynamics of arm motion. We analyzed the simulation to determine how each muscle contributed to the acceleration of the body mass center. During the early part of the stance phase, the quadriceps muscle group was the largest contributor to braking (i.e., backward acceleration of the mass center) and support. During the second half of the stance phase, the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles were the greatest contributors to propulsion and support. The arms did not contribute substantially to either propulsion or support, generating less than 1{\%} of the peak mass center acceleration. However, the arms effectively counterbalanced the vertical angular momentum of the lower extremities. Our analysis reveals that the quadriceps and plantarflexors are the major contributors to acceleration of the body mass center during running. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Ankle inversion sprains are the most frequent acute musculoskeletal injuries occurring in physical activity. Interventions that retrain muscle coordination have helped rehabilitate injured ankles, but it is unclear which muscle coordination strategies, if any, can prevent ankle sprains. The purpose of this study was to determine whether coordinated activity of the ankle muscles could prevent excessive ankle inversion during a simulated landing on a 30° incline. We used a set of musculoskeletal simulations to evaluate the efficacy of two strategies for coordinating the ankle evertor and invertor muscles during simulated landing scenarios: planned co-activation and stretch reflex activation with physiologic latency (60-ms delay). A full-body musculoskeletal model of landing was used to generate simulations of a subject dropping onto an inclined surface with each coordination condition. Within each condition, the intensity of evertor and invertor co-activity or stretch reflexes were varied systematically. The simulations revealed that strong preparatory co-activation of the ankle evertors and invertors prior to ground contact prevented ankle inversion from exceeding injury thresholds by rapidly generating eversion moments after initial contact. Conversely, stretch reflexes were too slow to generate eversion moments before the simulations reached the threshold for inversion injury. These results suggest that training interventions to protect the ankle should focus on stiffening the ankle with muscle co-activation prior to landing. The musculoskeletal models, controllers, software, and simulation results are freely available online at http://simtk.org/home/ankle-sprains, enabling others to reproduce the results and explore new injury scenarios and interventions.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate how the combination of seat pan inclination and friction coefficient influences the internal forces in the seated human body. Background: The focus on the ergonomics of sitting is increasing with the amount of time spent in a seated posture. A generic computer model of a chair has been developed and together with a detailed full-body musculoskeletal model it forms a new basis for investigation and understanding of the biomechanics of the seated human. Method: The analysis based on inverse dynamics and a minimum fatigue criterion is used for solving the redundancy problem of the muscles. The input to the analysis is different combinations of seat pan inclination and friction coefficient; the output is the individual muscle activities and spinal joint forces. Results: The computational investigations show that seat pan inclination and friction coefficient have a complex combined influence on muscle activity and spinal joint forces. Forward seat pan inclination appears to cause muscle fatigue unless sufficient friction is present, and in this case loses much of its beneficial effect for the spinal joint loads and leads to tissue shear forces that may be uncomfortable or even harmful. Conclusion: A generic chair model has been developed; the model can be adjusted in numerous ways. The chair together with a full body musculoskeletal model forms an efficient tool, which can be used in the design process of new chairs for quantifying the consequences of various design choices. It seems difficult to combine the desire for relaxation with the desire for minimum spinal loads. Relevance to industry: Detailed biomechanical modeling is a promising tool for furniture design, workplace design and indeed for improvement of occupational health. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {To investigate whether inflammatory markers are improved among patients with traumatic femur fractures who undergo RIA reamed intramedullary nailing (IMN) prior to fixation when compared to patients treated with standard reamed (SR) IMN. A prospective, randomized, single-blind trial was conducted on patients who had a closed femoral shaft fracture amenable to reamed IMN. Patients were randomized to undergo IMN with standard reaming or IMN with the RIA in a 1:1 ratio. Patients were stratified by Injury Severity Score (ISS) and by presence or absence of chest injury with AIS {\textgreater} 3. Patients had blood samples and bronchioalveolar lavage samples taken at specified time points pre- and postoperatively. Specimens from SR and RIA cohorts were compared for the presence of IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, TNF, and IL-10 in plasma and IL-1b and IL-8 in bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) samples to determine the relationship between inflammatory markers and intramedullary reaming. Nineteen consecutive patients participated in the study with 9 assigned in the RIA group and 10 in SR group. Significant differences existed for ISS between SR and RIA groups (p=0.04). Bronchial lavage data showed no statistical significant differences when RIA and standard reamers were compared and when ISS {\textgreater}16 and {\textless}16 were compared, however there were differences for the bronchial IL-8 change when those with chest injury were compared to those without chest injury. Plasma samples showed a trend towards increased IL-6 and IL-10 levels after reaming consistent with the second hit impact. A trend towards higher levels for IL-6 in the SR group was noted at 24 hours post-operatively whereas the IL-10 levels at the post-reaming time point were higher in the RIA group. This prospective study of reamer type indicates that RIA may be protective of systemic inflammation. This is supported by data showing decreased levels of IL-8 in the bronchial washings and increased level of IL-10 in the serum. Reaming and intramedullary fixation may cause an increase in IL-6 levels regardless of reamer type. Further investigations with a larger cohort of patients are desirable. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this paper, we design a novel knee exoskeleton. The designed exoskeleton has a 1 DOF with knee joint actuated in the sagittal plane. The exoskeleton is actuated base on Series Elastic Actuator (SEA) instead of traditonal stiff actuator. SEA is a compliant actuator, having the advantages of low output impedance, low friction, high quality force control and backdrivability. Thanks to these nice characteristics, it is easy to realize a safe and friendly human-machine interaction compare with traditonal stiff actuator. In order to achieve the goal of assistance as needed, a robust force control must be guaranteed. Sliding-Mode Control (SMC) is a way to robust force control. Instead of using the standard SMC, we employ Integral Sliding-Mode Control Algorithm (ISM) to avoid reaching phase, where the performance of system is not so good. Meanwhile, we also use continuous approximation of SMC, which can eliminate the effect of chattering. To verify the efficiency of ISM, we excutes the torque tarcking experiments. We also use the classical PID algorithm to compare with ISM. From the results of experiments, ISM outperform much better than PID, tracking the torque trajectory with high accuracy whereas employing PID produce high errors.},

abstract = {This study analyzes a practical scheme for controlling an exoskeleton robot with seven degrees of freedom (DOFs) that supports natural movements of the human arm. A redundant upper limb exoskeleton robot with seven DOFs is mechanically coupled to the human body such that it becomes a natural extension of the body. If the exoskeleton robot follows the movement of the human body synchronously, the energy exchange between the human and the robot will be reduced significantly. In order to achieve this, the redundancy of the human arm, which is represented by the swivel angle, should be resolved using appropriate constraints and applied to the robot. In a redundant 7-DOF upper limb exoskeleton, the pseudoinverse of the Jacobian with secondary objective functions is widely used to resolve the redundancy that defines the desired joint angles. A secondary objective function requires the desired joint angles for the movement of the human arm, and the angles are estimated by maximizing the projection of the longest principle axis of the manipulability ellipsoid for the human arm onto the virtual destination toward the head region. Then, they are fed into the muscle model with a relative damping to achieve more realistic robot-arm movements. Various natural arm movements are recorded using a motion capture system, and the actual swivel-angle is compared to that estimated using the proposed swivel angle estimation algorithm. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm provides a precise reference for estimating the desired joint angle with an error less than 5.},

abstract = {This paper presents a five degrees-of-freedom (DoF) low inertia shoulder exoskeleton. This device is comprised of two novel technologies. The first is 3DoF spherical parallel manipulator (SPM), which was developed using a new method of parallel manipulator design. This method involves mechanically coupling certain DoF of each independently actuated linkage of the parallel manipulator in order to constrain the kinematics of the entire system. The second is a 2DoF passive slip interface used to couple the user upper arm to the SPM. This slip interface increases system mobility and prevents joint misalignment caused by the translational motion of the user's glenohumeral joint from introducing mechanical interference. An experiment to validate the kinematics of the SPM was performed using motion capture. The results of this experiment validated the SPM's forward and inverse kinematic solutions through an Euler angle comparison of the actual and command orientations. A computational slip model was created to quantify the passive slip interface response for different conditions of joint misalignment. In addition to offering a low inertia solution for the rehabilitation or augmentation of the human shoulder, this device demonstrates a new method of motion coupling, which can be used to impose kinematic constraints on a wide variety of parallel architectures. Furthermore, the presented device demonstrates a passive slip interface that can be used with either parallel or serial robotic systems.},

abstract = {The aim was to devise a method of measuring friction at the hand/handle interface during a functional handgrip task. No descriptions of methods of this kind was found in the literature. An indirect technique of measuring normal grip force was employed to determine friction at the hand/handle interface while performing a functional handgrip action with a grabrail. The coefficient of static friction was calculated between palmar skin (dry, wet, and soapy hands) and five grabrail materials (stainless steel, powder-coated steel, chrome, textured aluminium and knurled steel). Thirty subjects participated (15 female, 15 male), who were aged from 17 to 45 years with a mean age of 30 years. Knurled steel produced a significantly larger mean coefficient of static friction than chrome, powder-coated steel and stainless steel, and textured aluminium had a significantly larger coefficient of static friction than stainless steel. Soapy hands produced the lowest mean coefficients (0.46 ± 0.04), significantly less then dry (1.72 An anatomical/functional argument for the existence of both, 0.16, p {\textless}0.001) and wet hands (1.42 ± 0.16, p {\textless}0.001). This study has demonstrated the influence of grabrail material and palmar skin treatments on static friction at the hand/handle interface. The use of a functional test that incorporates an indirect determination of normal handgrip force has provided a quantitative method of observing stability at the hand/handle interface.},

abstract = {With 300,000 paraplegic persons only in France, ischial pressure ulcers represent a major public health issue. They result from the buttocks' soft tissues compression by the bony prominences. Unfortunately, the current clinical techniques, with – in the best case – embedded pressure sensor mats, are insufficient to prevent them because most are due to high internal strains which can occur even with low pressures at the skin surface. Therefore, improving prevention requires using a biomechanical model to estimate internal strains from skin surface pressures. However, the buttocks' soft tissues' stiffness is still unknown. This paper provides a stiffness sensitivity analysis using a finite element model. Different layers with distinct Neo Hookean materials simulate the skin, fat and muscles. With Young moduli in the range [100–500 kPa], [25–35 kPa], and [80–140 kPa] for the skin, fat, and muscles, respectively, maximum internal strains reach realistic 50 to 60{\%} values. The fat and muscle stiffnesses have an important influence on the strain variations, while skin stiffness is less influent. Simulating different sitting postures and changing the muscle thickness also result in a variation in the internal strains.},

A total of 20 cadaveric wrists were tested in the intact state and after undergoing either a four-corner fusion or 2- and 3-bone fusion. The moment-rotation behaviour was measured in 24 directions of wrist motion about the forearm axis. The 2- and 3-bone fusion groups demonstrated increased radial deviation and pure flexion. Pure flexion was decreased in the four-corner fusion group. Radial extension and pure extension were decreased in all treatments compared with normal range of motion. Increasing the number of carpal bones within the fusion construct did not alter the functional axis of the wrist. Essentially equivalent motion is possible with 2-bone, 3-bone and four-corner fusions, with the exceptions of pure flexion and radial deviation. This data may influence surgeons when choosing between treatment methods. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE N/A.},

abstract = {Traditional industrial applications involve robots with limited mobility. Consequently, interaction (e.g. manipulation) was treated separately from whole-body posture (e.g. balancing), assuming the robot firmly connected to the ground. Foreseen applications involve robots with augmented autonomy and physical mobility. Within this novel context, physical interaction influences stability and balance. To allow robots to surpass barriers between interaction and posture control, forthcoming robotic research needs to investigate the principles governing whole-body motion and coordination with contact dynamics. There is a need to investigate the principles of motion and coordination of physical interaction, including the aspects related to unpredictability. Recent developments in compliant actuation and touch sensing allow safe and robust physical interaction from unexpected contact including humans. The next advancement for cognitive robots, however, is the ability not only to cope with unpredictable contact, but also to exploit predictable contact in ways that will assist in goal achievement. Last but not least, theoretical results needs to be validated in real-world scenarios with humanoid robots engaged in whole-body goal-directed tasks. Robots should be capable of exploiting rigid supportive contacts, learning to compensate for compliant contacts, and utilizing assistive physical interaction from humans. The work presented in this paper presents state-of-the-art in these domains as well as some recent advances made within the framework of the CoDyCo European project.},

AnyBody is capable of analyzing the musculoskeletal system of humans or other creatures as rigid-body systems. The paper introduces the main features of the system; in particular, the inverse dynamic analysis that resolves the fundamental indeterminacy of the muscle configuration. In addition to the musculoskeletal system, a model can comprise external objects, loads, and motion specifications, thereby providing a complete set of the boundary conditions for a given task. The paper also describes the basic ideas of structured model development in AnyBody. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Experiments were aimed at determining whether interface pressure measurements are a true reflection of skin contact pressure when made over different layers of clothing. Interface pressures were recorded at the skin interface and above clothing layers, with 11 participants wearing 10 different clothing combinations. The clothing used was standard issue British military clothing, including body armour (without ballistic plate). Participants wore both single and multiple clothing layers whilst walking on a treadmill carrying a loaded backpack (23.5kg, British military issue). Results showed no significant differences (p={\textgreater}0.05) in pressure between different clothing layers either singly, or worn in multiple. In conclusion, the soldier (or leisure user) will gain no or very little relief from applied pressure by wearing garments, even in layers, when carrying a backpack. Also, the findings suggest that interface pressure may adequately be assessed using a sensor placed above the clothing layer(s) rather than at skin surface. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Knowledge of the tribology of human skin is essential to improve and optimize surfaces and materials in contact with the skin. Besides that, friction between the human skin and textiles is a critical factor in the formation of skin injuries, which are caused if the loads and shear forces are high enough and/or over long periods of time. This factor is of particular importance in bedridden patients, since they are not moving about or are confined to wheelchairs. Decubitus ulcers are one of the most frequently-reported iatrogenic injuries in developed countries. The risk of developing decubitus ulcers can be predicted by using the "Braden Scale for Predicting Pressure Ulcer Risk" that was developed in 1987 and contains six areas of risk (cognitive-perceptual, immobility, inactivity, moisture, nutrition, friction/shear), although there are limitations to the use of such tools. The coefficient of friction of textiles against skin is mainly influenced by: the nature of the textile, skin moisture content and ambient humidity. This study will investigate how skin friction (different anatomical regions) varies, rubbing against different types of contacting materials (i.e., fabrics for medical use) under different contact conditions and their relationship in the formation and prevention of decubitus ulcers.},

abstract = {Integrating human and robot into a single system offers remarkable opportunities for creating a new generation of assistive technology. Having obvious applications in rehabilitation medicine and virtual reality simulation, such a device would benefit both the healthy and disabled population. The aim of the research is to study the kinematics and the dynamics of the human arm during daily activities in a free and unconstrained environment as part of an on-going research involved in the design of a 7 degree of freedom (DOF) powered exoskeleton for the upper limb. The kinematics of the upper limb was acquired with a motion capture system while performing a wide verity of daily activities. Utilizing a model of the human as a 7 DOF system, the equations of motion were used to calculate joint torques given the arm kinematics. During positioning tasks, higher angular velocities were observed in the gross manipulation joints (the shoulder and elbow) as compared to the fine manipulation joints (the wrist). An inverted phenomenon was observed during fine manipulation in which the angular velocities of the wrist joint exceeded the angular velocities of the shoulder and elbow joints. Analyzing the contribution of individual terms of the arm's equations of motion indicate that the gravitational term is the most dominant term in these equations. The magnitudes of this term across the joints and the various actions is higher than the inertial, centrifugal, and Coriolis terms combined. Variation in object grasping (e.g. power grasp of a spoon) alters the overall arm kinematics in which other joints, such as the shoulder joint, compensate for lost dexterity of the wrist. The collected database along with the kinematics and dynamic analysis may provide the fundamental understanding for designing powered exoskeleton for the human arm. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

Nowadays, these biomechatronic systems are used in different fields such as rehabilitation, military and industry. Since exoskeletons have close interaction surface with human body, it should be considered in biomechanical factors such as degrees of freedom, joints' range of motion, anthropometric dimensions and safety issues in designing such systems. The aim of this study was designing a lower extremity exoskeleton which does not create disorder in natural motion during user walking on a flat ground, beside parameters mentioned earlier. The design of this exoskeleton has been done in SolidWorks software based on gait kinematics data obtained from 10 subjects. The novelty of this study was usage of force generated by arm muscles of the user for helping him to walk. This idea beside simplification of the manufacturing process, decrease the cost and time too. The results of this study showed that the proposed mechanism in the design of this exoskeleton has appropriate coincidence with natural body states in degrees of freedom and joints' range of motion during walking.},

Advancements in technology have spurred a broad spectrum of research aimed at enhancing human performance and assisting in rehabilitation. The review underwent a holistic and extensive search and provides a reflective snapshot of the state of the art in exoskeleton design as it pertains to the incorporation of exoskeletons for ergonomic intervention.

abstract = {Purpose: Mass-spring-damper (MSD) models are often used for real-time surgery simulation due to their fast response and fairly realistic deformation replication. An improved real time simulation model of soft tissue deformation due to a laparoscopic surgical indenter was developed and tested. Method: The mechanical realization of conventional MSD models was improved using nonlinear springs and nodal dampers, while their high computational efficiency was maintained using an adapted implicit integration algorithm. New practical algorithms for model parameter tuning, collision detection, and simulation were incorporated. Results: The model was able to replicate complex biological soft tissue mechanical properties under large deformations, i.e., the nonlinear and viscoelastic behaviors. The simulated response of the model after tuning of its parameters to the experimental data of a deer liver sample, closely tracked the reference data with high correlation and maximum relative differences of less than 5 and 10{\%}, for the tuning and testing data sets respectively. Finally, implementation of the proposed model and algorithms in a graphical environment resulted in a real-time simulation with update rates of 150 Hz for interactive deformation and haptic manipulation, and 30 Hz for visual rendering. Conclusion: The proposed real time simulation model of soft tissue deformation due to a laparoscopic surgical indenter was efficient, realistic, and accurate in ex vivo testing. This model is a suitable candidate for testing in vivo during laparoscopic surgery. {\textcopyright} 2010 CARS.},

abstract = {During bouncing gaits such as hopping and running, leg muscles generate force to enable elastic energy storage and return primarily from tendons and, thus, demand metabolic energy. In an effort to reduce metabolic demand, we designed two elastic leg exoskeletons that act in parallel with the wearer's legs; one exoskeleton consisted of a multiple leaf (MLE) and the other of a single leaf (SLE) set of fiberglass springs. We hypothesized that hoppers, hopping on both legs, would adjust their leg stiffness while wearing an exoskeleton so that the combination of the hopper and exoskeleton would behave as a linear spring-mass system with the same total stiffness as during normal hopping. We also hypothesized that decreased leg force generation while wearing an exoskeleton would reduce the metabolic power required for hopping. Nine subjects hopped in place at 2.0, 2.2, 2.4, and 2.6 Hz with and without an exoskeleton while we measured ground reaction forces, exoskeletal compression, and metabolic rates. While wearing an exoskeleton, hoppers adjusted their leg stiffness to maintain linear spring-mass mechanics and a total stiffness similar to normal hopping. Without accounting for the added weight of each exoskeleton, wearing the MLE reduced net metabolic power by an average of 6{\%} and wearing the SLE reduced net metabolic power by an average of 24{\%} compared with hopping normally at frequencies between 2.0 and 2.6 Hz. Thus, when hoppers used external parallel springs, they likely decreased the mechanical work performed by the legs and substantially reduced metabolic demand compared with hopping without wearing an exoskeleton.

abstract = {Upper extremity (UX) movement analysis by means of 3D kinematics has the potential to become an important clinical evaluation method. However, no standardized protocol for clinical application has yet been developed, that includes the whole upper limb. Standardization problems include the lack of a single representative function, the wide range of motion of joints and the complexity of the anatomical structures. A useful protocol would focus on the functional status of the arm and particularly the orientation of the hand. The aim of this work was to develop a standardized measurement method for unconstrained movement analysis of the UX that includes hand orientation, for a set of functional tasks for the UX and obtain normative values. Ten healthy subjects performed four representative activities of daily living (ADL). In addition, six standard active range of motion (ROM) tasks were executed. Joint angles of the wrist, elbow, shoulder and scapula were analyzed throughout each ADL task and minimum/maximum angles were determined from the ROM tasks. Characteristic trajectories were found for the ADL tasks, standard deviations were generally small and ROM results were consistent with the literature. The results of this study could form the normative basis for the development of a 'UX analysis report' equivalent to the 'gait analysis report' and would allow for future comparisons with pediatric and/or pathologic movement patterns. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This project is focusing on the development of robot-assisted stroke rehabilitation system of human upper limb and arm. Realizing the complexity of human upper limb, the study is limited to human arm, consisting of 3 glenohumeral joints (abduction-adduction, flexion-extension, and rotation) and elbow joint (flexion-extension). Rehabilitation robot is used to assist patient to move their hand to a desired position. A 7 degree of freedom (DoFs) kinematical model of human arm, and an 11 DoFs human hand kinematical model are presented in this paper. The model was defined based on the literature survey and assumptions are made to reduce the complexity. Denavit-Hartenberg method is used for the positional analysis to determine the end position in 3D space while the Lagrange-Euler method is used for the dynamic analysis. A PID computed torque controller was designed by utilizing the equation of motion. The purpose of the controller is to compensate the dynamical imperfection and the presence of disturbance. MATLAB and Simulink was used in developing the mathematical model while Anybody Modeling System was used for physical modeling and simulation. {\textcopyright}2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {Physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) integrates the benefits of human operator and a collaborative robot in tasks involving physical interaction, with the aim of increasing the task performance. However, the design of interaction controllers that achieve safe and transparent operations is challenging, mainly due to the contradicting nature of these objectives. Knowing that attaining perfect transparency is practically unachievable, controllers that allow better compromise between these objectives are desirable. In this article, we propose a multicriteria optimization framework, which jointly optimizes the stability robustness and transparency of a closed-loop pHRI system for a given interaction controller. In particular, we propose a Pareto optimization framework that allows the designer to make informed decisions by thoroughly studying the tradeoff between stability robustness and transparency. The proposed framework involves a search over the discretized controller parameter space to compute the Pareto front curve and a selection of controller parameters that yield maximum attainable transparency and stability robustness by studying this tradeoff curve. The proposed framework not only leads to the design of an optimal controller, but also enables a fair comparison among different interaction controllers. In order to demonstrate the practical use of the proposed approach, integer and fractional order admittance controllers are studied as a case study and compared both analytically and experimentally. The experimental results validate the proposed design framework and show that the achievable transparency under fractional order admittance controller is higher than that of integer order one, when both controllers are designed to ensure the same level of stability robustness.},

abstract = {Objective To investigate the effects of an automated stride assistance device that assists hip joint flexion and extension movement in energy expenditure during walking in healthy young adults using an expired gas method.
Design Prospective, single-group design to compare the differences of energy expenditure between 2 assistive conditions.
Setting Laboratory.
Participantsg Healthy volunteers (N=10) aged 21 to 32 years.
Interventions Not applicable.
Main Outcome Measures Oxygen consumption per unit time (Vo2) cost (ml{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}m-1), and heart rate (beats/min) were measured in 2 assistive conditions (with 3-Nm hip motion assistance and without assistance) and at 2 walking speeds (comfortable walking speed [CWS] and maximum walking speed [MWS]).
Results There were no significant differences in walking speed between the with- and without-assistance conditions at either the CWS or MWS. The Vo2 cost and heart rate were significantly reduced in the with-assistance condition compared with the without-assistance condition, at both the CWS and MWS. The reduction in the Vo2 cost during the with-assistance condition, relative to the without-assistance condition, was 7.06{\%} at the CWS and 10.52{\%} at the MWS.
Conclusions The automated stride assistance device is useful for reducing energy expenditure during walking in healthy adults. Further studies are warranted to investigate if this device provides substantial help to individuals with impaired mobility as a result of strength deficits.},

abstract = {Risk factors for bone loss among the elderly are largely unknown. The objective of the study was to examine longitudinal bone loss in the hip in one-hundred and sixty-two 75-year-old women. Bone mineral density (BMD, g/cm2) was measured with dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and after 4 years. The relationship between changes in BMD during follow-up and the following factors; baseline BMD, baseline weight, weight change, baseline lean and fat body mass (measured with DXA), serum values of biochemical markers and hormones, nutritional and lifestyle factors according to a questionnaire was assessed. The annual mean (SD) change in femoral neck BMD was -0.31{\%} (1.38) in total trochanter -0.35{\%} (1.15) and total hip -0.34{\%} (1.10) and did not differ significantly between measurement sites. Bisphosphonate users had a 2.9{\%}, 1.7{\%} and 1.9{\%} mean adjusted increase in femoral neck, total trochanter and total hip BMD respectively, different from none-users (p {\textless} 0.05). Subjects with more than three weekly physical activity sessions had less femoral neck bone loss than less active women (p {\textless} 0.05). The proportion of the variance in BMD changes explained by multivariate models (R2) was 12-13{\%}. Women gaining weight had less loss of BMD than those losing weight in the trochanter and the total hip (p {\textless} 0.001), and in the femoral neck (p = 0.055). Elderly women should be advised to maintain their body weight and participate in physical activity. Despite the large number of variables examined in this study, bone loss occurring with increased age is not thoroughly explained. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Muscle volume is known to correlate with maximal joint torque in humans, but the role of muscle moment arm in determining maximal torque is less clear. Moderate correlations have been reported between maximal isometric knee extensor torque and knee extensor moment arm, but no such observations have been made for the ankle joint. It has been suggested that smaller muscle moment arms may enhance force generation at high rates of joint rotation, but this has not yet been observed for ankle muscles in vivo. The purpose of the present study was to correlate plantar flexor moment arm and plantar flexor muscle volume with maximal plantar flexor torque measured at different rates of plantar flexion. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to quantify the plantar flexor moment arm and muscle volume of the posterior compartment in 20 healthy young men. Maximal plantar flexor torque was measured isometrically and at three plantar flexion speeds using an isokinetic dynamometer. Plantar flexor torque was significantly correlated with muscle volume (0.222 {\textless} R2 {\textless} 0.322) and with muscle moment arm at each speed (0.323 {\textless} R2 {\textless} 0.494). While muscle volume was strongly correlated with body mass and stature, moment arm was not. The slope of the torque-moment arm regression line decreased as the rate of joint rotation increased, indicating that subjects with small moment arms experienced smaller reductions in torque at high speeds. The findings of this study suggest that plantar flexor moment arm is a determinant of joint strength that is at least as important as muscle size. {\textcopyright} 2014 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract = {The need for upper limb assistive and wearable exoskeletons is growing in various fields, e.g. either to support patients with neuromuscular disabilities or to reduce the effort strains on workers. These exoskeletons should reduce the efforts required by the user during functional tasks (dynamic consideration) and should fit the user's size (geometric consideration). This is a tedious task, due to the 3D human-exoskeleton interactions, and to the complex and interdependent selection of the power transmission characteristics, i.e. motors or passive elements. There are still few guidelines and few clear procedures to support geometric and dynamic syntheses of these exoskeletons. The objective of this study is to develop a procedure for geometric and dynamic syntheses of assistive upper limb exoskeletons, to serve as a tool to optimize their design. Firstly, a geometric optimization of the exoskeleton dimensions enabled to satisfy the kinematic loop closures between the exoskeleton and the user for a maximum of positions while carrying out specific functional tasks and avoiding collisions with the body segments. Secondly, through an optimal control problem, the dynamic characteristics of the exoskeleton were obtained by minimizing the user's joint torques for the functional tasks. Closing the kinematic loops of the exoskeletons with optimized dimensions was achieved for all positions of the user while carrying out the functional tasks, which was 10.8{\%} more than with a visual identification of the dimensions. The resulting dynamic parameters could reduce the user's joint torque to less than 10.6{\%} of the human-only simulations for nearly all joints and tasks. These results showed that the geometric and dynamic synthesis procedures were successful. This is important, as it can enable the development of dedicated exoskeletons, such as lighter and smaller exoskeletons. The future perspectives will be to build an optimization framework, where the geometric and dynamic parameters could be optimized together, and to minimize the user's muscle forces instead of joint torques for specific design purposes.},

The methods employed involved the use of high-speed motion picture film, force plate and foot-switch data. The Achilles and anterior tibial tendon forces, the compressive and tangential (shear) forces across the ankle during stance phase of gait were determined, based on a quasi-static analysis. During stance phase of gait normal subjects used a mean of 24.4 degree of sagittal plane ankle motion. Patients with ankle joint disease showed reduced motion which returned to near normal values 1 year following total ankle replacement. Compressive force across the ankle joint rose to about 5 times body weight during the latter part of stance phase. Backward, or aft, shear forces or nearly full body weight were demonstrated during all but the last 20{\%} of stance phase. Patients with ankle joint disease apparently altered their gait to markedly reduce these forces. Following total ankle replacement, shear forces returned toward more normal values, but compressive forces were not significantly changed.},

abstract = {Exoskeletons and wearable robotic systems have advanced substantially over the last decade for gait assistance, rehabilitation and load-carrying purposes. Currently, there are commercially available devices with stiff actuators. However, these actuators cannot adapt to their unpredictable environments. Thus, compliant actuators like series elastic and variable stiffness actuators have been implemented in exoskeletons and active orthoses. This paper presents a novel design and experimental characterization of a compliant actuator with adjustable stiffness for a lower limb wearable ankle robot (VS-AnkleExo). The proposed actuator is designed to mimic the behavior of biological ankle and maximizes the compliance between user and robot during a gait cycle. The adjustable stiffness of actuator is achieved through a controllable transmission ratio mechanism. Both transparency and tracking performance experiments are performed to demonstrate reduced the user-robot interaction force and improved the tracking performance of the proposed actuator, respectively. Experimental results showed that interaction forces between the user and robot are minimized in the transparency experiments, while the actuators proposed are able to track the given torque signals at various frequencies in the tracking experiments.},

abstract = {Research on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is entering a new phase. The main driver behind this is an awareness that biodiversity loss operates at large spatial scales and generally involves reductions and changes in species at different trophic levels simultaneously. Evaluating how ecosystem processes are likely to change following species loss at multiple trophic levels will be difficult because of the feedbacks between levels and between levels and the ecosystem processes of interest. Similarly, carrying out manipulative experiments designed to accommodate multiple trophic levels at the landscape scales in which society is interested will be extremely challenging. Novel approaches, such as the BioMERGE (Biotic Mechanisms of Ecosystem Regulation in the Global Environment) initiative, are needed. In addition, future work should be more services-oriented, rather than process-oriented, if effects of biodiversity change on services are to be properly assessed. Finally, the application of mainstream ecosystem ecology to biodiversity–ecosystem functioning research seems to have been neglected to date. In this respect, there is potential for the mass-balance approach to contribute to the debate.},

The circuitous joint adopts the symmetric pinion and rack mechanism (SPRM) with the parallel mechanism. The exoskeleton finger is a serial mechanism composed of three closed-chain SPRM joints in series. The kinematic equations of the open chain of the finger and the closed chains of the SPRM joints were built to analyze the kinematics of the hand rehabilitation exoskeleton. The experimental setup of the hand rehabilitation exoskeleton was built and the continuous passive motion (CPM) rehabilitation experiment and the test of human-robot interaction force measurement were conducted. Experiment results show that the mechanical design of the hand rehabilitation robot is reasonable and that the kinematic analysis is correct, thus the exoskeleton can be used for the hand rehabilitation of stroke patients.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present an algorithm for planning and control of legged robot locomotion. Given the desired contact sequence, this method generates gaits and dynamic motions for legged robots without resorting to simplified stability criteria. The method uses direct collocation for searching for solutions within the constraint-consistent subspace defined by the robot's contact configuration. For the differential equation constraints of the collocation algorithm, we use the so-called direct dynamics of a constrained multibody system. The dynamics of a legged robot is different for each contact configuration. Our method deals with such a hybrid nature, and it allows for velocity discontinuities when contacts are made. We introduce the projected impact dynamics constraint to enforce consistency during mode switching. We stabilize the plan using an inverse dynamics controller compatible with the optimal feed-forward control of the motion plan. As a whole, this approach reduces the complexity associated with specifying dynamic motions of a floating-base robot under the constant influence of contact forces. We apply this method on a hydraulically-actuated quadruped robot. We show two types of gaits (walking and trotting) as well as diverse jumping motions (forward, sideways, turning) on the real system. The results presented here are one of the few examples of an optimal control problem solved and satisfactorily transferred to a real torquecontrolled legged robot.},

abstract = {This contribution is concerned with joint angle calculation based on inertial measurement data in the context of human motion analysis. Unlike most robotic devices, the human body lacks even surfaces and right angles. Therefore, we focus on methods that avoid assuming certain orientations in which the sensors are mounted with respect to the body segments. After a review of available methods that may cope with this challenge, we present a set of new methods for: (1) joint axis and position identification; and (2) flexion/extension joint angle measurement. In particular, we propose methods that use only gyroscopes and accelerometers and, therefore, do not rely on a homogeneous magnetic field. We provide results from gait trials of a transfemoral amputee in which we compare the inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based methods to an optical 3D motion capture system. Unlike most authors, we place the optical markers on anatomical landmarks instead of attaching them to the IMUs. Root mean square errors of the knee flexion/extension angles are found to be less than 1° on the prosthesis and about 3° on the human leg. For the plantar/dorsiflexion of the ankle, both deviations are about 1°. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {Tactile sensors are essential for robotic systems to interact safely and effectively with the external world, they also play a vital role in some smart healthcare systems. Despite advances in areas including materials/composites, electronics and fabrication techniques, it remains challenging to develop low cost, high performance, durable, robust, soft tactile sensors for real-world applications. This paper presents the first Soft Inductive Tactile Sensor (SITS) which exploits an inductance-transducer mechanism based on the eddy-current effect. SITSs measure the inductance variation caused by changes in AC magnetic field coupling between coils and conductive films. Design methodologies for SITSs are discussed by drawing on the underlying physics and computational models, which are used to develop a range of SITS prototypes. An exemplar prototype achieves a state-of-the-art resolution of 0.82 mN with a measurement range over 15 N. Further tests demonstrate that SITSs have low hysteresis, good repeatability, wide bandwidth, and an ability to operate in harsh environments. Moreover, they can be readily fabricated in a durable form and their design is inherently extensible as highlighted by a 4 × 4 SITS array prototype. These outcomes show the potential of SITS systems to further advance tactile sensing solutions for integration into demanding real-world applications.},

abstract = {The first functional load-carrying and energetically autonomous exoskeleton was demonstrated at the University of California, Berkeley, walking at the average speed of 1.3 m/s (2.9 mph) while carrying a 34 kg (75 lb) pay load. Four fundamental technologies associated with the Berkeley lower extremity exoskeleton were tackled during the course of this project. These four core technologies include the design of the exoskeleton architecture, control schemes, a body local area network to host the control algorithm, and a series of on-board power units to power the actuators, sensors, and the computers. This paper gives an overview of one of the control schemes. The analysis here is an extension of the classical definition of the sensitivity function of a system: the ability of a system to reject disturbances or the measure of system robustness. The control algorithm developed here increases the closed-loop system sensitivity to its wearer's forces and torques without any measurement from the wearer (such as force, position, or electromyogram signal). The control method has little robustness to parameter variations and therefore requires a relatively good dynamic model of the system. The trade-offs between having sensors to measure human variables and the lack of robustness to parameter variation are described. Copyright 漏 2006 by ASME.},

abstract = {This paper presents the design, control and performance of a high fidelity four degree-of-freedom wrist exoskeleton robot, RiceWrist, for training and rehabilitation. The RiceWrist is intended to provide kinesthetic feedback during the training of motor skills or rehabilitation of reaching movements. Motivation for such applications is based on findings that show robot-assisted physical therapy aids in the rehabilitation process following neurological injuries. The exoskeleton device accommodates forearm supination and pronation, wristflexion and extension and radial and ulnar deviation in a compact parallel mechanism design with low friction, zero backlash and high stiffness. As compared to other exoskeleton devices, the RiceWrist allows easy measurement of human joint angles and independent kinesthetic feedback to individual human joints. In this paper, joint-space as well as task-space position controllers and an impedance-based force controller for the device are presented. The kinematic performance of the device is characterized in terms of its workspace, singularities, manipulability, backlash and backdrivability. The dynamic performance of RiceWrist is characterized in terms of motor torque output, joint friction, step responses, behavior under closed loop set-point and trajectory tracking control and display of virtual walls. The device is singularity free, encompasses most of the natural workspace of the human joints and exhibits low friction, zero-backlash and high manipulability, which are kinematic properties that characterize a highquality impedance display device. In addition, the device displays fast, accurate response under position control that matches human actuation bandwidth and the capability to display sufficiently hard contact with little coupling between controlled degrees-of-freedom.},

Especially with the increasing number of patients with stroke or other neurological disorders and the gradually aging population, people may need wearable exoskeletons that actively assist human's movements. In designing these robots, physical humanrobot interaction (pHRI) plays an important role. How to let human and robot cooperatively perform motor tasks and help each other is a grand challenge. Our research establishes a human-robot physical symbiosis framework that biomimics human's behavior when performing interactive motor skills. The human and robot are modeled as two adaptive controllers in parallel with the plant (system under control). As a result, we will have two feedback controllers working together, constantly adapting to each other's behavior and optimally stabilizing the plant to achieve a common goal. In addition, we propose an inverse optimal control method to estimate human control strategy. This information can enable the robot to predict future consensus interactive behaviors in order to cooperate with the human effectively. Experimental verifications have been carried out using double inverted pendulum to simulate a human-robot cooperative balance task in MATLAB environment.},

It is applicable to inertial measurement units (IMUs) consisting of tri-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers, and magnetic angular rate and gravity (MARG) sensor arrays that also include tri-axis magnetometers. The MARG implementation incorporates magnetic distortion compensation. The algorithm uses a quaternion representation, allowing accelerometer and magnetometer data to be used in an analytically derived and optimised gradient descent algorithm to compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative. Performance has been evaluated empirically using a commercially available orientation sensor and reference measurements of orientation obtained using an optical measurement system. Performance was also benchmarked against the propriety Kalman-based algorithm of orientation sensor. Results indicate the algorithm achieves levels of accuracy matching that of the Kalman based algorithm; {\textless} 0.8° static RMS error, {\textless} 1.7° dynamic RMS error. The implications of the low computational load and ability to operate at small sampling rates significantly reduces the hardware and power necessary for wearable inertial movement tracking, enabling the creation of lightweight, inexpensive systems capable of functioning for extended periods of time. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

In order to realise gains in functional independence, devices that target the distal joints of the arm are necessary. Further, the robotic device must exhibit key dynamic properties that enable both high dynamic transparency for assessment, and implementation of novel interaction control modes that significantly engage the participant. In this paper, we present the kinematic design, dynamical characterization, and clinical validation of the RiceWrist-S, a serial robotic mechanism that facilitates rehabilitation of the forearm in pronation-supination, and of the wrist in flexion-extension and radial-ulnar deviation. The RiceWrist-Grip, a grip force sensing handle, is shown to provide grip force measurements that correlate well with those acquired from a hand dynamometer. Clinical validation via a single case study of incomplete spinal cord injury rehabilitation for an individual with injury at the C3-5 level showed moderate gains in clinical outcome measures. Robotic measures of movement smoothness also captured gains, supporting our hypothesis that intensive upper limb rehabilitation with the RiceWrist-S would show beneficial outcomes.},

abstract = {Exoskeleton of lower extremity, as a kind of wearable robot, can help people who have walking problems and offer rehabilitation training. In this work, through the analysis of human walking, the mechanical structure of an exoskeleton system was studied. By judging the user's intended movement with the measured pressure of the feet, the exoskeleton system works to assist the user. Then, surface EMG signal, directly reflecting the motion of muscles and joints, was collected during the action of standing up and sitting down on a chair. Finally, a kind of data algorithm was proposed to processing the signal. A control strategy is presented to control the Lower-Limb Exoskeleton based on the EMG signal. Future work will concentrate on developing a more reliable Exoskeleton System involved in EMG signals.},

abstract = {Fatone S, Gard SA, Malas BS. Effect of ankle-foot orthosis alignment and foot-plate length on the gait of adults with poststroke hemiplegia. Objective: To investigate the effect of ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) alignment and foot-plate length on sagittal plane knee kinematics and kinetics during gait in adults with poststroke hemiplegia. Design: Repeated measures, quasi-experimental study. Setting: Motion analysis laboratory. Participants: Volunteer sample of adults with poststroke hemiplegia (n=16) and able-bodied adults (n=12) of similar age. Interventions: Subjects with hemiplegia were measured walking with standardized footwear in 4 conditions: (1) no AFO (shoes only); (2) articulated AFO with 90° plantar flexion stop and full-length foot-plate-conventionally aligned AFO (CAFO); (3) the same AFO realigned with the tibia vertical in the shoe-heel-height compensated AFO (HHCAFO); and (4) the same AFO (tibia vertical) with 3/4 length foot-plate-3/4 AFO. Gait of able-bodied control subjects was measured on a single occasion to provide a normal reference. Main Outcome Measures: Sagittal plane ankle and knee kinematics and kinetics. Results: In adults with hemiplegia, walking speed was unaffected by the different conditions (P=.095). Compared with the no AFO condition, all AFOs decreased plantar flexion at initial contact and mid-swing (P{\textless}.001) and changed the peak knee moment in early stance from flexor to extensor (P{\textless}.000). Both AFOs with full-length foot-plates significantly increased the peak stance phase plantar flexor moment compared with no AFO and resulted in a peak knee extensor moment in early stance that was significantly greater than control subjects, whereas the AFO with three-quarter length foot-plate resulted in ankle dorsiflexion during stance and swing that was significantly less than control subjects. Conclusions: These findings suggest that when an articulated AFO is to be used, a full-length foot-plate in conjunction with a plantar flexion stop may be considered to improve early stance knee moments for people with poststroke hemiplegia. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.},

abstract = {Objective: To generate evidence of the effectiveness of hip protectors to minimize risk of hip fracture at the time of falling among residents of long-term care (LTC) by contrasting rates of hip fractures between falls with and without hip protectors. Design: A 12-month, retrospective cohort study. We retrospectively reviewed fall incident reports recorded during the 12 months prior to baseline in participating homes. Setting and participants: A population-based sample comprising all residents from 14 LTC homes owned and operated by a single regional health authority, who experienced at least 1 recorded fall during the 12-month study. Results: At baseline, the pooled mean (standard deviation) age of residents in participating homes was 82.7 (11.3) years and 68{\%} were female. Hip protectors were worn in 2108 of 3520 (60{\%}) recorded falls. Propensity to wear hip protectors was associated with male sex, cognitive impairment, wandering behavior, cardiac dysrhythmia, use of a cane or walker, use of anti-anxiety medication, and presence of urinary and bowel incontinence. The incidence of hip fracture was 0.33 per 100 falls in falls with hip protectors compared with 0.92 per 100 falls in falls without hip protectors, representing an unadjusted relative risk (RR) of hip fracture of 0.36 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.14–0.90, P = .029) between protected and unprotected falls. After adjusting for propensity to wear hip protectors, the RR of hip fracture was 0.38 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.14–0.99, P = .048) during protected vs unprotected falls. Conclusions and implications: Hip protectors were worn in 60{\%} of falls, and the risk of hip fracture was reduced by nearly 3-fold by wearing a hip protector at the time of falling. Given that most clinical trials have failed to attain a similar level of adherence, our findings support the need for future research on the benefits of dissemination and implementation strategies to maximize adherence with hip protectors in LTC.},

abstract = {During a human-exoskeleton collaboration, the interaction torque on exoskeleton resulting from the human cannot be clearly determined and conducted by normal physical models. This is because the torque depends not only on direction and orientation of both human-operator and exoskeleton but also on the phys-ical properties of each operator. In this paper, we present our investigations on the relationship between the interaction torques with the dynamic factors of the human-exoskeleton systems using state-of-the-art learning techniques (nonparametric regression techniques) and provide control applications based on the findings. Exper- imental data was collected from various human-operators when they were attached to the designed exoskeleton to perform unconstraint motions with and without control. The results showed that regardless of how the ex- periments were done and which learning method was chosen, the resulting interaction could be best represented by time varying non-linear mappings of the operator's angular position, and the exoskeleton's angular position, velocity, and acceleration during locomotion. This finding has been applied to advanced controls of the lower exoskeletal robots in order to improve their performance while interacting with human.},

abstract = {Abstract—This paper describes the design and the experi- mental testing of a knee exoskeleton with variable non-active interval (NAI) specifically designed to fit the human gait. This exoskeleton is designed to provide support at the knee joint by supplying assistive torque around the knee in order to reduce the maximum muscular effort required to perform daily activities such as walking and squat lifting, thus, enabling users like elderly people to continue those activities longer. The main mechanism of the exoskeleton behaves like a torsion spring with a variable NAI. The torque provided by the mechanism outside the NAI is quasi-linear with respect to the angle variation. The position of this NAI can be modified to disable the mechanism. Moreover, the angular stiffness of the mechanism can be modified to adapt the magnitude of the support to the user. Experimental evaluation was conducted in two phases: during the first one, the NAI was tested for following the walking pattern of the user, in order to avoid disturbing the user's gait. During the second one, the performance of the support provided by the device was measured by the muscle activity during squatting series. The results show the ability to modify the position of the NAI and a decrease of the maximum muscle activity during squatting while wearing the device, concluding that the exoskeleton could assist the knee joint although further evaluation is required to establish the whole support in the gait cycle},

abstract = {The central nervous system of humans and other animals modulates spinal cord activity to achieve several locomotion behaviors. Previous neuromechanical models investigated the modulation of human gait changing selected parameters belonging to CPGs (Central Pattern Generators) feedforward oscillatory structures or to feedback reflex circuits. CPG-based models could replicate slow and fast walking by changing only the oscillation's properties. On the other hand, reflex-based models could achieve different behaviors through optimizations of large dimensional parameter spaces. However, they could not effectively identify individual key reflex parameters responsible for gait characteristics' modulation. This study investigates which reflex parameters modulate the gait characteristics through neuromechanical simulations. A recently developed reflex-based model is used to perform optimizations with different target behaviors on speed, step length, and step duration to analyze the correlation between reflex parameters and their influence on these gait characteristics. We identified nine key parameters that may affect the target speed ranging from slow to fast walking (0.48 and 1.71 m/s) as well as a large range of step lengths (0.43 and 0.88 m) and step duration (0.51, 0.98 s). The findings show that specific reflexes during stance significantly affect step length regulation, mainly given by positive force feedback of the ankle plantarflexors' group. On the other hand, stretch reflexes active during swing of iliopsoas and gluteus maximus regulate all the gait characteristics under analysis. Additionally, the results show that the hamstrings' group's stretch reflex during the landing phase is responsible for modulating the step length and step duration. Additional validation studies in simulations demonstrated that the modulation of identified reflexes is sufficient to regulate the investigated gait characteristics. Thus, this study provides an overview of possible reflexes involved in modulating speed, step length, and step duration of human gaits.},

abstract = {In present study, a knee exoskeleton was designed to assist human movements in the flexion/extension of the knee. Moreover, a control method was proposed for the exoskeleton to track the desired position trajectory of the knee. Subsequently, an integrated human shank and exoskeleton model based on the sitting position was considered. A nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) was used to reduce the influence of the uncertainties and external disturbance in modeling of the whole system. Furthermore, a backstepping sliding control (BSC) approach combined with the nonlinear observer was presented. To improve performance of BSC, genetic algorithm (GA) was employed to determine the optimal backstepping sliding control law parameters. The asymptotic stability of the presented controller and nonlinear disturbance observer convergence were mathematically verified based on the Lyapunov theory. The superiority of the proposed control method is shown in comparison to some recent new methods. The suggested controller can reduce the disturbance rejection time. The chattering and tracking error of NDO sliding mode control was also reduced. The proposed controller was simulated in MATLAB (a registered trademarks of The MathWorks, Inc.) and OpenSim was used to model the human knee. Moreover, some experimental results verified the designed system and its simulation and illustrated that the backstepping sliding mode controller based on the nonlinear disturbance observer can track the reference position by considering a nonlinear model of the identification errors and the external disturbances.},

abstract = {Much of this thesis looked at performing a cogent literature review of exoskeletons to determine the state-of-the-art and to determine the remaining needs in exoskeletal design. The literature review of over 80 journals, allowed the researcher to determine the lack of research in upper body exoskeletons for training in civilian, military, and law enforcement personnel. Thus the genesis of the Armed Robotic Control for Training in Civilian L aw Enforcement, or ARCTiC LawE, an upper body exoskeleton designed to assist civilian, military, and law enforcement personnel in accurate, precise, and reliable handgun techniques. This exoskeleton training utilizes a laser based handgun with similar dimensions, trigger pull, and break action to a Glock {\textregistered} 19 pistol, common to both public and private security sectors. The project aims to train and test subjects with no handgun training/experience with the ARCTiC LawE, and without, and compare the results of accuracy, precision, and speed. Ultimately, the exoskeleton greatly impacts sensory motor learning and the biomechanical implications are confirmed via both performance and physiological measurements. The researchers believe the ARCTiC LawE to be a viable substitute for training with live fire hand guns to reduce the cost of training time and munitions and will increase accuracy and precisions for typical law enforcement and military live fire drills. Additionally, this project increases the breadth of knowledge for exoskeletons as a tool for training.},

abstract = {Two human-robot interactions, including a haptic interaction and a teleoperated interaction, are explored in this paper with a new exoskeleton-type masterarm, in which the electric brakes with the torque sensor beams are used for force reflection. In the haptic interaction with virtual environment, the masterarm is used as a haptic device and tested to examine how the resistant torque of the electric brake for the force reflection is implemented in contact regime prior to conducting the teleoperated interaction. Two types of virtual environments, a rigid wall with high stiffness (hard contact with 10 [KN/m]) and a soft wall with low stiffness (soft contact with 0.1 [N/m]), are integrated with the masterarm for the haptic interaction. In hard contact, large force is fed back to the human operator, and makes the human operator hardly move. The electric brake with the torque sensor beam can detect the torque and its direction so that it allows free motion as well as contact motion by releasing or holding the movement of the operator. The experimental results show how the electric brake is switched from contact to free regime to allow the operator to move freely, especially when the operator intends to move toward the free regime in contact. In soft contact, the force applied to the human operator can be increased or decreased proportionally to the torque amount sensed by the torque sensor beam, thus the operator can feel the contact force proportional to the amount of the deformation during the contact. Finally, the masterarm is integrated with the humanoid robot, CENTAUR developed at Korea Institute of Science and Technology to conduct a pick-and-place task through the teleoperated interaction. It is examined that the CENTAUR as a slave robot can follow the movement of the operator.},

abstract = {Until today it is not entirely clear how humans interact with automated gait rehabilitation devices and how we can, based on that interaction, maximize the effectiveness of these exoskeletons. The goal of this study was to gain knowledge on the human-robot interaction, in terms of kinematics and muscle activity, between a healthy human motor system and a powered knee exoskeleton (i.e., KNEXO). Therefore, temporal and spatial gait parameters, human joint kinematics, exoskeleton kinetics and muscle activity during four different walking trials in 10 healthy male subjects were studied. Healthy subjects can walk with KNEXO in patient-in-charge mode with some slight constraints in kinematics and muscle activity primarily due to inertia of the device. Yet, during robot-in-charge walking the muscular constraints are reversed by adding positive power to the leg swing, compensating in part this inertia. Next to that, KNEXO accurately records and replays the right knee kinematics meaning that subject-specific trajectories can be implemented as a target trajectory during assisted walking. No significant differences in the human response to the interaction with KNEXO in low and high compliant assistance could be pointed out. This is in contradiction with our hypothesis that muscle activity would decrease with increasing assistance. It seems that the differences between the parameter settings of low and high compliant control might not be sufficient to observe clear effects in healthy subjects. Moreover, we should take into account that KNEXO is a unilateral, 1 degree-of-freedom device.},

This paper presents a new type of supernumerary robotic limbs (SRL) that supports the human body against floors, walls, and surrounding structures so that the human can perform a task safely, comfortably, and stably. First, the use of wearable robots for securing and supporting a human body is discussed, followed by an SRL design concept. The SRL is worn around the waist and can brace the human body by making contact with a wall, grasping a rail, or being anchored to the floor. Quasi-static stability and compliance with which the body is supported are analyzed. Two control methods for stabilizing the body support system are considered: one is null-space stabilization using Hessian matrices, and the other is joint servo stiffness, based on the Jacobian. A prototype robot is designed and tested. Potential applications of the SRL in diverse fields are discussed.},

abstract = {The human sense of touch is an integral part of daily life. For tasks involving grasping and manipulation of objects, force feedback is a key requirement. Most of the systems give contact point or complete grasping force feedback; for precision grasping and other physical interactions, finger awareness and force feedback from independent fingers is essential. In this study a novel, wearable proprioceptive rehabilitation system is designed which restores the ability of identifying and distinguishing between individual fingers of a prosthetic hand or an exoskeleton in a non-invasive manner. Moreover, it provides different levels of force feedback from every finger as well, which enables the user to distinguish and control force in precision grasping activities. For testing the system accuracy, classical psychophysical methods were used on a group of 14 voluntary disabled subjects. The tests were conducted in both, ideal and real-world conditions i.e. without and with distractions and accuracies were calculated accordingly. A p-test was also conducted to observe significance between the samples of with and without distraction datasets. The system performed with an overall accuracy of 82.04{\%} which was well above the min. performance measure of 60{\%}. Vi-HaB is standalone system and can be mounted on any upper limb rehabilitation (prosthesis, exoskeleton) system for finger awareness and force feedback.},

abstract = {In this research, an adaptive lower limb exoskeleton (AEXO) has been designed and constructed as a rehabilitation device. It is important during the rehabilitation that a user obtains assistance from the exoskeleton in an adaptive manner, as the user may improve his/her walking during rehabilitation. The assistance from the machine will be less or more according to the current situation of the user during the use of the exoskeleton. The question then arises as to how the exoskeleton can provide adaptive adjustment. It was decided that a tangible design was to measure the user status such as the user interaction force during walking. In this design, force sensors are installed on each link of exoskeleton to record the user walking effort during walking. By measuring this force, the control computer of the exoskeleton will understand for each cycle what the status of the user is and predict an adaptive torque according to measured force. In order to generate a suitable torque, the compliant motion control, which is a combination of impedance and admittance control is used. Walking experiments of a healthy person to wear the AEXO have been carried out in the lab. The first experiment verified the propose algorithm by using a predefined reference trajectory for the user and giving an adjustment to the reference trajectory based on the interaction torque. The second experiment verified that even without the predefined gait trajectory to the user, the exoskeleton can move in compliance to the user under various walking speeds. For the future development, the method will be expanded and tested for people who suffer from stroke or other walking impairment.},

abstract = {Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of a tissue can be simultaneously obtained using two indentation tests with two different sized indentors in two indentations. Owing to the assumption of infinitesimal deformation of the indentation, the finite deformation effect of indentation on the calculated material parameters was not fully understood in the double indentation approach. However, indentation tests with infinitesimal deformation are not practical for the measurement of real tissues. Accordingly, finite element models were developed to simulate the indentation with different indentor diameters and different deformation ratios to investigate the finite deformation effect of indentation. The results indicated that Young's modulus E increased with the increase in the indentation deformation w, if the finite deformation effect of indentation was not considered. This phenomenon became obvious when Poisson's ratio v approached 0.5 and/or the ratio of indentor radius and tissue thickness a/h increased. The calculated Young's modulus could be different by 23{\%} at 10{\%} deformation in comparison with its real value. The results also demonstrated that the finite deformation effect to indentation on the calculation of Poisson's ratio v was much smaller. After the finite deformation effect of indentation was considered, the error of the calculated Young's modulus could be controlled within 5{\%} (a/h = 1) and 2{\%} (a/h = 2) for deformation up to 10{\%}. {\textcopyright} IFMBE: 2005.},

The design of NEUROExos focused on three solutions that enable its use for poststroke physical rehabilitation. First, double-shelled links allow an ergonomic physical human-robot interface and, consequently, a comfortable interaction. Second, a four-degree-of-freedom passive mechanism, embedded in the link, allows the user's elbow and robot axes to be constantly aligned during movement. The robot axis can passively rotate on the frontal and horizontal planes 30{\&}{\#}x00B0; and 40{\&}{\#}x00B0;, respectively, and translate on the horizontal plane 30 mm. Finally, a variable impedance antagonistic actuation system allows NEUROExos to be controlled with two alternative strategies: independent control of the joint position and stiffness, for robot-in-charge rehabilitation mode, and near-zero impedance torque control, for patient-in-charge rehabilitation mode. In robot-in-charge mode, the passive joint stiffness can be changed in the range of 24-56 N{\&}{\#}x00B7;m/rad. In patient-in-charge mode, NEUROExos output impedance ranges from 1 N{\&}{\#}x00B7;m/rad, for 0.3 Hz motion, to 10 N{\&}{\#}x00B7;m/rad, for 3.2 Hz motion.},

abstract = {The location of the hip joint centre (HJC) is required for calculations of hip moments, the location and orientation of the femur, and muscle lengths and lever arms. In clinical gait analysis, the HJC is normally estimated using regression equations based on normative data obtained from adult populations. There is limited relevant anthropometric data available for children, despite the fact that clinical gait analysis is predominantly used for the assessment of children with cerebral palsy. In this study, pelvic MRI scans were taken of eight adults (ages 23–40), 14 healthy children (ages 5–13) and 10 children with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy (ages 6–13). Relevant anatomical landmarks were located in the scans, and the HJC location in pelvic coordinates was found by fitting a sphere to points identified on the femoral head. The predictions of three common regression equations for HJC location were compared to those found directly from MRI. Maximum absolute errors of 31mm were found in adults, 26mm in children, and 31mm in the cerebral palsy group. Results from regression analysis and leave-one-out cross-validation techniques on the MRI data suggested that the best predictors of HJC location were: pelvic depth for the antero-posterior direction; pelvic width and leg length for the supero-inferior direction; and pelvic depth and pelvic width for the medio-lateral direction. For single-variable regression, the exclusion of leg length and pelvic depth from the latter two regression equations is proposed. Regression equations could be generalised across adults, children and the cerebral palsy group.},

The resonance frequency shift by muscle contraction was measured by piezoelectric material. The developed sensor can measure muscle activations accurately over clothes and this is an advantage over the conventional surface Electromyography (sEMG). Performances of the sensor are evaluated through isometric wrist flexion motion tests based on maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) in two aspects: accuracy and speed. While the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) contraction tests up to 40{\%} MVC, sensor outputs are compared with force sensor outputs. The result shows that we can measure muscle contraction by the developed sensor with high correlation and fast response, which is desirable for many physical human robot interactions including exoskeleton devices.},

abstract = {For a physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) system such as an exoskeleton, it has been an important issue to control the interaction force between the user and the actuators because it directly determines the accuracy of the realized impedance. However, the accurate force control of the exoskeleton system has not been fully achieved due to the difficulties caused by uncertainties from pHRI. To overcome this problem, in this study, the series elastic actuator (SEA) was operated by a time delay control (TDC), which directly compensated the uncertainties without an accurate model of them, realizing the designed model dynamics in the actuator. However, in spite of the successful application of TDC, the delays between the desired and model dynamics severely degraded the force control performance of the SEA. Thus, a new strategy named model-inverse time delay control was proposed by introducing a virtual reference predicted by the inverse of model dynamics in TDC. The proposed method significantly improved performance of the force control, and it was verified by demonstrating zero impedance control with pHRI, free oscillation of a pendulum, and force control in the exoskeleton.},

abstract = {The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the effects of different partial wrist fusions on wrist motion. A total of 20 cadaveric wrists were tested in the intact state and after undergoing either a four-corner fusion or 2- and 3-bone fusion. The moment-rotation behaviour was measured in 24 directions of wrist motion about the forearm axis. The 2- and 3-bone fusion groups demonstrated increased radial deviation and pure flexion. Pure flexion was decreased in the four-corner fusion group. Radial extension and pure extension were decreased in all treatments compared with normal range of motion. Increasing the number of carpal bones within the fusion construct did not alter the functional axis of the wrist. Essentially equivalent motion is possible with 2-bone, 3-bone and four-corner fusions, with the exceptions of pure flexion and radial deviation. This data may influence surgeons when choosing between treatment methods.},

abstract = {The purpose of this work is to introduce a newly developed exoskeleton robot designed to characterize the neuromuscular properties of the shoulder, including intrinsic and reflexive mechanisms, during static posture and dynamic movement in a 3-dimensional space. Quantitative characterization of these properties requires fast perturbation ({\textgreater}100?/s) to separate their contribution from that of voluntary mechanism. Understanding these properties of the shoulder control could assist in the rehabilitation or enhancement of upper limb performance during physical human-robot interaction. The device can be described as a new type of spherical parallel manipulator (SPM) that utilizes three 4-bar (4B) substructures to decouple and control roll, pitch and yaw of the shoulder. By utilizing a parallel architecture, the 4B- SPM exoskeleton has the advantage of high acceleration, fast enough to satisfy the speed requirement for the characterization of distinct neuromuscular properties of the shoulder. In this work, the prototype is presented, along with an evaluation of its position accuracy and step response. The development and preliminary testing of the 4B-SPM exoskeleton presented in this work demonstrates its potential to be a useful tool for studying the neuromuscular mechanisms of the shoulder joint.},

@article{Robinovitch1995,
abstract = {The risk for hip fracture from a fall is known to decrease with increased body mass index (weight/height2), a relative measure of obesity. To explore whether this reduced risk is due to the protective effect of increased soft‐tissue cushioning in obese individuals, we used an impact pendulum and surrogate human pelvis to conduct simulated fall impact experiments on trochanteric soft tissues harvested from the cadavers of nine elderly individuals. For each impact, the total applied energy was 140 J. Peak forces ranged from 4,050 to 6,420 N, and tissue energy absorption ranged from 8.4 to 81.6 J. Increased tissue thickness correlated strongly with both decreased peak force (r2 = 0.91) and increased tissue energy absorption (r2 = 0.76). However, peak forces in all cases were within 1 SD of previously reported average fracture forces forces elderly cadaveric femora. This suggests that force attenuation in trochanteric soft tissues alone is insufficient to prevent hip fracture in falls in which an elderly person lands directly on the hip. In such falls, additional energy‐absorbing mechanisms, such as breaking the fall with an outstretched hand and eccentric contraction of the quadriceps during descent, are likely to be involved if fracture does not occur.

abstract = {Although the merits of electromyography (EMG)-based control of powered assistive systems have been certified, the factors that affect the performance of EMG-based human-robot cooperation, which are very important, have received little attention. This study investigates whether a more physiologically appropriate model could improve the performance of human-robot cooperation control for an ankle power-assist exoskeleton robot. To achieve the goal, an EMG-driven Hill-type neuromusculoskeletal model (HNM) and a linear proportional model (LPM) were developed and calibrated through maximum isometric voluntary dorsiflexion (MIVD). The two control models could estimate the real-time ankle joint torque, and HNM is more accurate and can account for the change of the joint angle and muscle dynamics. Then, eight healthy volunteers were recruited to wear the ankle exoskeleton robot and complete a series of sinusoidal tracking tasks in the vertical plane. With the various levels of assist based on the two calibrated models, the subjects were instructed to track the target displayed on the screen as accurately as possible by performing ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. Two measurements, the root mean square error (RMSE) and root mean square jerk (RMSJ), were derived from the assistant torque and kinematic signals to characterize the movement performances, whereas the amplitudes of the recorded EMG signals from the tibialis anterior (TA) and the gastrocnemius (GAS) were obtained to reflect the muscular efforts. The results demonstrated that the muscular effort and smoothness of tracking movements decreased with an increase in the assistant ratio. Compared with LPM, subjects made lower physical efforts and generated smoother movements when using HNM, which implied that a more physiologically appropriate model could enable more natural and human-like human-robot cooperation and has potential value for improvement of human-exoskeleton interaction in future applications.},

abstract = {Muscles attach to bones via tendons that stretch and recoil, affecting muscle force generation and metabolic energy consumption. In this study, we investigated the effect of tendon compliance on the metabolic cost of running using a full-body musculoskeletal model with a detailed model of muscle energetics. We performed muscle-driven simulations of running at 2-5 m/s with tendon force-strain curves that produced between 1 and 10{\%} strain when the muscles were developing maximum isometric force. We computed the average metabolic power consumed by each muscle when running at each speed and with each tendon compliance. Average whole-body metabolic power consumption increased as running speed increased, regardless of tendon compliance, and was lowest at each speed when tendon strain reached 2-3{\%} as muscles were developing maximum isometric force. When running at 2 m/s, the soleus muscle consumed less metabolic power at high tendon compliance because the strain of the tendon allowed the muscle fibers to operate nearly isometrically during stance. In contrast, the medial and lateral gastrocnemii consumed less metabolic power at low tendon compliance because less compliant tendons allowed the muscle fibers to operate closer to their optimal lengths during stance. The software and simulations used in this study are freely available at simtk.org and enable examination of muscle energetics with unprecedented detail.},

abstract = {Recent literature emphasizes the importance of comfort in the design of exosuits and other assistive devices that physically augment humans; however, there is little quantitative data to aid designers in determining what level of force makes users uncomfortable. To help close this knowledge gap, we characterized human comfort limits when applying forces to the shoulders, thigh and shank. Our objectives were: (i) characterize the comfort limits for multiple healthy participants, (ii) characterize comfort limits across days, and (iii) determine if comfort limits change when forces are applied at higher vs. lower rates. We performed an experiment (N = 10) to quantify maximum tolerable force pulling down on the shoulders, and axially along the thigh and shank; we termed this force the comfort limit. We applied a series of forces of increasing magnitude, using a robotic actuator, to soft sleeves around their thigh and shank, and to a harness on their shoulders. Participants were instructed to press an off-switch, immediately removing the force, when they felt uncomfortable such that they did not want to feel a higher level of force. On average, participants exhibited comfort limits of {\~{}}0.9–1.3 times body weight on each segment: 621±245 N (shoulders), 867±296 N (thigh), 702 ±220 N (shank), which were above force levels applied by exosuits in prior literature. However, individual participant comfort limits varied greatly ({\~{}}250–1200 N). Average comfort limits increased over multiple days (p{\textless}3e-5), as users habituated, from {\~{}}550–700 N on the first day to {\~{}}650–950 N on the fourth. Specifically, comfort limits increased 20{\%}, 35{\%} and 22{\%} for the shoulders, thigh and shank, respectively. Finally, participants generally tolerated higher force when it was applied more rapidly. These results provide initial benchmarks for exosuit designers and end-users, and pave the way for exploring comfort limits over larger time scales, within larger samples and in different populations.},

abstract = {Accurate and reliable event prediction is imperative for supporting movement with an exoskeleton. Two events are important during a sit-to-stand movement: seat-off, the event at which the subject leaves the chair and start-of-assistance for hip and knee, the earliest time at which assistance may be provided. This letter analyzes two methods to predict and detect these events. Both methods only have joint encoder data as input. The model-based method uses probabilistic principle component analysis with a Kalman filter. Based on a statistically learned model, a joint trajectory is predicted. The seat-off event is predicted using its correlation with maximum hip angle. Since the start-of-assistance event has no clear correlation with joint trajectories, it cannot be detected with this method. The model-free method is a feed-forward neural network, which learns a mapping between inputs and events directly. It is applied to both seat-off prediction and start-of-assistance detection. Methods have been evaluated on 311 lab-recorded movements. For the seat-off event, the model-based method is more reliable than the model-free method. For the start-of-assistance event, the model-free method performs well, except in an outlier case for one subject. Both of these methods allow accurate and reliable event prediction, only using joint encoder data as inputs.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a simultaneous and continuous kinematics estimation method for multiple DoFs across shoulder and elbow joint. Although simultaneous and continuous kinematics estimation from surface electromyography (EMG) is a feasible way to achieve natural and intuitive human-machine interaction, few works investigated multi-DoF estimation across the significant joints of upper limb, shoulder and elbow joints. This paper evaluates the feasibility to estimate 4-DoF kinematics at shoulder and elbow during coordinated arm movements. Considering the potential applications of this method in exoskeleton, prosthetics and other arm rehabilitation techniques, the estimation performance is presented with different muscle activity decomposition and learning strategies. Principle component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) are respectively employed for EMG mode decomposition with artificial neural network (ANN) for learning the electromechanical association. Four joint angles across shoulder and elbow are simultaneously and continuously estimated from EMG in four coordinated arm movements. By using ICA (PCA) and single ANN, the average estimation accuracy 91.12{\%} (90.23{\%}) is obtained in 70-s intra-cross validation and 87.00{\%} (86.30{\%}) is obtained in 2-min inter-cross validation. This result suggests it is feasible and effective to use ICA (PCA) with single ANN for multi-joint kinematics estimation in variant application conditions.},

Instead of using a load cell to measure the resulting interaction force, we propose a distributed measure of the normal interaction pressure over the whole contact area between the user and the machine. To obtain this measurement, a soft silicone tactile sensor is inserted between the limb and commonly used connection cuffs. The advantage of this approach is that it allows for a distributed measure of the interaction pressure, which could be useful for rehabilitation therapy assessment purposes, or for control. Moreover, the proposed solution does not change the comfort of the interaction; can be applied to connection cuffs of different shapes and sizes; and can be manufactured at a low cost. Preliminary results during gait assistance tasks show that this approach can precisely detect changes in the pressure distribution during a gait cycle.},

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of walking speed and uneven terrain on the load magnitude, distribution, and rate of loading at the human-crutch contact surfaces. Our results show that the rates of loading were significantly increased with higher walking speeds and while negotiating certain irregular terrains, despite there being no apparent effect on the peak force transmission, suggesting load rate may be a more appropriate metric for assessing terrain effects on crutch gait.

abstract = {This paper presents a new portable exoskeleton glove developed for assistance in activities of daily living (ADL). The proposed glove is soft, adjustable, allows unconstrained motion of the wrist, and leaves the palm free for object grasping and manipulation. In the proposed design, both flexion and extension motions of the thumb and three fingers (excluding the little finger) are supported by respective bidirectional actuators. The kinematics of the device were derived and are presented along with an experimental evaluation. The developed glove system is compact and light, with the weights of the wearable part and the whole system being 250 and 340 g, respectively. The maximum pinch force provided by the device was experimentally measured to be 16 N, which gives the proposed device one of the highest power-to-weight ratio among existing portable devices for hand ADL assistance. The usability of the developed device was verified in a series of indoor and outdoor tests. The glove allowed test subjects to hold and manipulate versatile objects with diameters up to 90 mm and weighing 300 g. When powered by a conventional 3000-mAh battery, the glove could operate continuously performing grasping task for 4 h.},

abstract = {The validity of current inverse dynamics models utilized for motion analysis is investigated. It is shown that observables generated by the real biosystem, such as ground reaction forces, are incompatible with comparable responses of skeletodynamical inverse models currently in use. This implies that results obtained with such models are erroneous to varying degrees while a quantification of these errors is difficult or impossible. This phenomenon is termed the fundamental myoskeletal inverse dynamics problem. A model fidelity indicator is proposed which, for a specific inverse dynamics model applied to a particular motion, provides a dimensionless numerical measure for the replicative validity of that model and the fidelity of its input data. A practical example demonstrates the usefulness of this indicator. It is suggested that the development of structurally sufficiently complex and biologically more realistic skeletomechanical models as well as substantial error reductions in data measuring and processing procedures will be necessary to improve the accuracy of inverse dynamics model computations. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Hip fractures caused by the falls in the elderly can lead to serious injuries that diminish their quality of life. The soft pads and wearable airbag have been developed and commercialized to prevent hip fractures of the elderly. In this study, the hip impact simulator was developed and the impact forces of six types soft pads and the hip protection airbag were measured by using the hip impact simulator. In addition, the distribution of the impact force and maximum contact area were also measured by attaching the pressure sensor on the surrogate pelvis of the hip impact simulator. Experiments were performed depending on the conditions protecting the surrogate pelvis (unpadded, soft pad, airbag) and the fall from 20 to 40 cm heights were repeated three times depending on each condition. The hip protection airbag decreased the mean pressure applied on the hip joint by decreasing a peak impact force according to the increased maximum contact area compared to the unpadded and soft pad conditions at all fall heights. Therefore, it can be concluded that the hip protection airbag can prevent the hip fracture by effectively attenuating impact force during falls in the elderly.},

However, particular emphasis is placed on characterizing and visualizing the physical as well as mathematical nature of the singularities, singular gimbal angles, singular momentum surfaces, null motion manifolds, and degenerate null motions. The mathematical framework for characterizing the geometric property of singular surfaces is also established by applying the surface theory of differential geometry. Two and three parallel single-gimbal CMG configurations and a typical pyramid array of four single-gimbal CMGs (including a special case of 90-deg skew angle) are examined in detail to illustrate the various concepts and approaches useful for characterizing and visualizing the CMG singularities.},

abstract = {A novel 3-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) spherical mechanism, singularity-free in the anatomical shoulder joint workspace, is described. The use of curved scissors linkages interconnected by revolute joints, whose axes share the same remote centre-of-motion, achieves the most compact design of its kind. The kinematics of this scissors shoulder mechanism (SSM) are derived and presented. A design equation restricting the linkage's curvature by the central/pitch angle of the fully stretched scissors is obtained. Motion-captured data are used for validating the reachable 3-d workspace while a test-subject is wearing a null protraction/retraction constrained exoskeleton. The embodiment of the SSM as a shoulder joint for an exoskeleton device does not compromise the upper extremity function within the anatomical reachable 3-d workspace. It operates within a volume of 0.236 m3, corresponding to 68.09{\%} and 94.97{\%} of the volumes of the full active (0.350 m3) and null protraction/retraction constrained active (0.223 m3) reachable workspaces of the test-subject, respectively. Thus, the SSM represents a simplification of a spatial spherical mechanism design and overcomes the need for the use of redundant links and optimization routines.},

Thus, for the application to the industrial field, this work proposes an assistive robotic exoskeleton attached to the calf and thigh of the human leg to totally support a worker's body weight in stand-to-sit with the various seated positions. For this, in this work, a four-bar mechanism based various combinations of passive and active actuators are investigated. Finally the proposed system is composed of one rotary actuator and linear spring based on a four-bar mechanism, considering the high power efficiency for the weight and the mechanical solution to the backdrivability problem of a geared drive. From the extensive simulations, the basic actuation mechanism of the proposed assistive device is confirmed. Then it is verified from experimental results that the robotic exoskeleton can be used to aid who weighs maximum 85 kg in the arbitrary seated position and is actuated with nearly zero current consumption in the walking. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

These systems and their interfaces are generally tightly-coupled and well-defined. For large-scale human-robot applications, the systems may be unknown prior to designing the interface for potential human interaction. This presents a difficult goal for allowing multiple users to interact with many possibly unknown systems. In this paper, we present an interaction infrastructure aligned with providing this interface. It operates in two phases that accommodate both many-to-many interaction and generalized, one-to-one interaction between users and robotic systems. Our previous research has demonstrated the infrastructure to scale to a large number of users and several systems in simulation. The experiments in this paper substantiate these results in a smaller-scale real robotic environment.},

The use of the McKibben artificial muscle has opened the way to the introduction of muscle suits - compact, lightweight, reliable, wearable assist-bots enabling manual worker to lift and carry weights. By applying integral electromyography (IEMG), we show quantitative performance results and efficiency of the muscle suit in terms of keeping posture and lifting. However index for quantitative estimation is only IEMG. In this paper, we then introduce Oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin which express the form whether hemoglobin has oxygen or not. Since muscle uses the oxygen a lot, by observing the change in the amount of Oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin, we assume it is possible to recognize the condition of muscle use. As a result, we find that the differences of value between Oxy and Doxy after using muscle may be likened to declare fatigue of muscle.},

abstract = {We examined the metabolic cost of plantar flexor muscle-tendon mechanical work during human walking. Nine healthy subjects walked at constant step frequency on a motorized treadmill at speeds corresponding to 80{\%} (1.00 m s -1), 100{\%} (1.25 m s-1), 120{\%} (1.50 m s-1) and 140{\%} (1.75 m s-1) of their preferred step length (L*) at 1.25 m s-1. In each condition subjects donned robotic ankle exoskeletons on both legs. The exoskeletons were powered by artificial pneumatic muscles and controlled using soleus electromyography (i.e. proportional myoelectric control). We measured subjects' metabolic energy expenditure and exoskeleton mechanics during both unpowered and powered walking to test the hypothesis that ankle plantarflexion requires more net metabolic power (W kg-1) at longer step lengths for a constant step frequency (i.e. preferred at 1.25 m s-1). As step length increased from 0.8 L* to 1.4 L*, exoskeletons delivered ∼25{\%} more average positive mechanical power (P=0.01; +0.20±0.02 W kg-1 to +0.25±0.02 W kg-1, respectively). The exoskeletons reduced net metabolic power by more at longer step lengths (P=0.002; -0.21±0.06 W kg-1 at 0.8 L* and -0.70±0.12 W kg-1 at 1.4 L*). For every 1 J of exoskeleton positive mechanical work subjects saved 0.72 J of metabolic energy ('apparent efficiency'=1.39) at 0.8 L* and 2.6 J of metabolic energy ('apparent efficiency'=0.38) at 1.4 L*. Declining ankle muscle-tendon 'apparent efficiency' suggests an increase in ankle plantar flexor muscle work relative to Achilles' tendon elastic energy recoil during walking with longer steps. However, previously stored elastic energy in Achilles' tendon still probably contributes up to 34{\%} of ankle muscle-tendon positive work even at the longest step lengths we tested. Across the range of step lengths we studied, the human ankle muscle-tendon system performed 34-40{\%} of the total lower-limb positive mechanical work but accounted for only 7-26{\%} of the net metabolic cost of walking.},

abstract = {Summary: We studied the incidence of second hip fractures and medication use among the patients with sequential hip fractures. This study shows that the incidence rate of second hip fractures is higher than that of the first hip fractures. Improvement in osteoporosis care and a more critical policy for prescription of psychotropic drugs are needed. Introduction: This study had two goals: (1) to determine incidence of second hip fractures; (2) to describe changes in pharmacotherapy between first and second hip fractures, especially the use of those psychotropics which increase the risk of falling and also pharmacotherapy for osteoporosis. Methods: The residents of Central Finland Health Care District who had sustained a hip fracture in 2002-2003 were followed up for subsequent hip fractures until 2006. Hip fracture patients were identified and clinical data were obtained by using hospital registers and medical records. Results: Five hundred and one persons aged ≥ 60 years suffered their first hip fracture in 2002-2003. During the follow-up of 936 person-years, 34 second hip fractures occurred. The cumulative incidence of second hip fractures was 5.08{\%} (95{\%} CI: 3.30 to 7.78) at one year, and 8.11{\%} (95{\%} CI: 5.73 to 11.43) at two years after the first fracture. The second part of this study investigated 75 patients with two non-contemporaneous hip fractures. Between the first and second fractures, the number of psychotropic drug users rose from 27 (36{\%}) to 44 (59{\%}). At the time of second hip fracture, osteoporosis had been diagnosed in 17 (23{\%}) patients only. Twelve (16{\%}) patients used bisphosphonates or calcitonin, 15 (20{\%}) used calcium and 9 (12{\%}) vitamin D supplements. Conclusions: There is a high incidence of second hip fractures. Secondary prevention of hip fractures needs to be improved. In addition to adequate treatment for osteoporosis, more attention should be directed toward appropriate use of psychotropic drugs. {\textcopyright} 2007 International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.},

abstract = {We used QCT scans obtained in 687 men and women, 21-97 years of age, to estimate the factor of risk for vertebral fracture, Phi(vert), defined as the ratio of spinal loading to vertebral strength. With age, vertebral strength declined and Phi(vert) increased significantly more in women than men. Age- and sex-specific differences in Phi(vert) closely resembled previously reported vertebral fracture incidence. INTRODUCTION: Despite the high prevalence of vertebral fractures, little is known about the interaction between spinal loading and vertebral fragility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed the ratio of spinal loading to vertebral strength (i.e., the factor of risk, Phi(vert)) in an age- and sex-stratified population-based sample of 700 women and men 21-97 years of age. We measured volumetric BMD (vBMD, mg/cm3) and cross-sectional area (CSA, cm2) of the midvertebral bodies of L1-L3 using QCT and computed vertebral compressive strength from these data using engineering beam theory. A biomechanical model of the trunk was used to estimate compressive forces applied to the L3 vertebral body during standing, bending forward, and bending forward while lifting 10 kg. The factor of risk for fracture, Phi(vert), was computed as the ratio of spinal compressive force to vertebral strength for each activity. RESULTS: Men had a higher vertebral strength at all ages, largely because of their greater CSA. Whereas both sexes exhibited a marked decline in vertebral compressive strength with age (p {\textless} 0.001), the decline was greater in women than men (-43{\%} versus -31{\%}, p = 0.008). Compressive forces on L3 were greater in men than women, because of their greater body weight and height. For both sexes, forces during bending and lifting were 8-fold higher than those experienced during upright standing. For all activities, Phi(vert) increased with age, but significantly more so in women than men (p {\textless} 0.001). For bending and lifting, Phi(vert-bending) exceeded 1.0 in 30{\%} of women and 12{\%} of men {\textgreater} or =50 years of age, values that are similar to the reported frequency of vertebral fracture. CONCLUSION: These findings illustrate potential mechanisms underlying vertebral fractures and provide strong rationale for further evaluation of this QCT-based biomechanical approach for assessment of fracture risk.},

abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of hip protectors (HP) in preventing hip fractures (HF) in patients with dementia. Design: A case-control study. Setting: Four specialized dementia units. Participants: 206 physically independent patients with dementia. Interventions: Beginning in January 2004, following the recommendation of the Israeli Ministry of Health, we recommended the use of HP (Hip Saver-nursing home type) to each family/guardian of all patients in these departments. Measurements: The rate of falls and HF per falls in patients with and without HP. Results: We achieved patient compliance of 70{\%} to 80{\%} for wearing the HP 24 hours a day; 106 patients were permanently wearing HP for a total period of 1905 months. Of those, subgroup B of 63 patients had been monitored prior to January 2004, before HP were introduced. One hundred patients of the same departments have never used HP; together with the months of follow-up before January 2004 in subgroup B, the follow-up period in patients not wearing HP, reached a total of 3136 months. There was no statistical difference between patients with/without HP regarding age, gender, comorbidities, routine laboratory findings, and medications. The rate of falls was not significantly different in patients with and without HP. However, there was a significant difference in the rate of hip fractures (HF): in patients not wearing HP there were 323 falls resulting in 14 HF, and in patients wearing HP, 260 falls but only 2 HF (4.3{\%} versus 0.8{\%}, respectively, P = .007, chi-square test, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.3-24.6, NNT = 28). Conclusions: When appropriately introduced and used, hip protectors have high efficacy in preventing hip fractures in long-term care patients with dementia. The medical, social, and economic beneficial outcomes are substantial. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Medical Directors Association.},

abstract = {Biomechanical models of the musculoskeletal system are frequently used to study neuromuscular control and simulate surgical procedures. To be broadly applicable, a model must be accessible to users, provide accurate representations of muscles and joints, and capture important interactions between joints. We have developed a model of the upper extremity that includes 15 degrees of freedom representing the shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, thumb, and index finger, and 50 muscle compartments crossing these joints. The kinematics of each joint and the force-generating parameters for each muscle were derived from experimental data. The model estimates the muscle-tendon lengths and moment arms for each of the muscles over a wide range of postures. Given a pattern of muscle activations, the model also estimates muscle forces and joint moments. The moment arms and maximum moment-generating capacity of each muscle group (e.g., elbow flexors) were compared to experimental data to assess the accuracy of the model. These comparisons showed that moment arms and joint moments estimated using the model captured important features of upper extremity geometry and mechanics. The model also revealed coupling between joints, such as increased passive finger flexion moment with wrist extension. The computer model is available to researchers at http://nmbl.stanford.edu . {\textcopyright} 2005 Biomedical Engineering Society.},

abstract = {Robot-assisted surgery is often carried out through master-slave teleoperation. With the progress of robotic technology and development of novel surgical procedures, new challenges emerge like need for haptic feedback and time delay in teleoperation communication channels, etc. Most existing bilateral teleoperation works in literature emphasize more on maintaining system stability at the cost of degraded transparency, with time variant communication delay further worsening the situation. In this paper, we present a nonlinear Hunt-Crossley model-mediated bilateral teleoperation scheme with targeted applications in robot-assisted surgery. The system stability is guaranteed by decoupling the master and slave sub-systems and the system transparency is enhanced with online environment parameter estimation using recursive least squares (RLS) technique. Simulation studies have been carried out for both constant and time varying interaction environments. The proposed teleoperation scheme is shown to be efficient in providing stable and transparent performance and robust against communication delay and environment parameter variance.},

This paper presents research into electronic textile strain sensors designed specifically for wearable applications which need to be lightweight, robust, and comfortable. In this paper, sixteen stretch sensors, each with different conductive stretch fabrics, are evaluated: EeonTex (Eeonyx Corporation), knitted silver-plated yarn, and knitted spun stainless steel yarn. The sensors' performance is tested using a tensile tester while monitoring their resistance with a microcontroller. Each sensor was analyzed for its sensitivity, linearity, hysteresis, responsiveness, and fatigue through a series of dynamic and static tests. The findings show that for wearable applications a subset of the silver-plated yarn sensors had better ranked performance in terms of sensitivity, linearity, and steady state. EeonTex was found to be the most responsive, and the stainless steel yarn performed the worst, which may be due to the characteristics of the knit samples under test.},

abstract = {Wearable robots for carrying heavy loads in an industrial field should be able to carry a load over their entire range of motion. The payload capacity of a wearable robot employing rotary actuators or linear actuators at the knee joints decreases drastically in the knee-flexion posture, because the moment arm of gravity increases and the moment arm of the force generated by the linear actuators at the knees decreases after a certain point. To resolve this issue, this study proposes two types of sublink mechanisms for the knee joints. With only a few modifications to the existing knee-joint configuration, the moment arm in the knee-flexion posture is increased and the payload capacity is effectively increased, and thus, enabling robot pilots to squat down and stand up with heavy loads. The proposed mechanisms were simulated and tested with a wearable robot, and their effectiveness was verified.},

abstract = {With the fourth revolution of healthcare, i.e., Healthcare 4.0, collaborative robotics is spilling out from traditional manufacturing and will blend into human living or working environments to deliver care services, especially telehealthcare. Because of the frequent and seamless interaction between robots and care recipients, it poses several challenges that require careful consideration: 1) the ability of the human to collaborate with the robots in a natural manner; and 2) the safety of the human collaborating with the robot. In this regard, we have proposed a proximity sensing solution based on the self-capacitive technology to provide an extended sense of touch for collaborative robots, allowing approach and contact measurement to enhance safe and natural human-robot collaboration. The modular design of our solution enables it to scale up to form a large-area sensing system. The sensing solution is proposed to work in two operation modes: the interaction mode and the safety mode. In the interaction mode, utilizing the ability of the sensor to localize the point of action, gesture command is used for robot manipulation. In the safety mode, the sensor enables the robot to actively avoid obstacles.},

abstract = {Motion sensors as inertial measurement units (IMU) are widely used in robotics, for instance in the navigation and mapping tasks. Nowadays, many low cost micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS) based IMU are available off the shelf, while smartphones and similar devices are almost always equipped with low-cost embedded IMU sensors. Nevertheless, low cost IMUs are affected by systematic error given by imprecise scaling factors and axes misalignments that decrease accuracy in the position and attitudes estimation. In this paper, we propose a robust and easy to implement method to calibrate an IMU without any external equipment. The procedure is based on a multi-position scheme, providing scale and misalignments factors for both the accelerometers and gyroscopes triads, while estimating the sensor biases. Our method only requires the sensor to be moved by hand and placed in a set of different, static positions (attitudes). We describe a robust and quick calibration protocol that exploits an effective parameterless static filter to reliably detect the static intervals in the sensor measurements, where we assume local stability of the gravity's magnitude and stable temperature. We first calibrate the accelerometers triad taking measurement samples in the static intervals. We then exploit these results to calibrate the gyroscopes, employing a robust numerical integration technique. The performances of the proposed calibration technique has been successfully evaluated via extensive simulations and real experiments with a commercial IMU provided with a calibration certificate as reference data.},

abstract = {Recovery of upper and lower limbs function is essential to reach independence in daily activities in patients with upper motor neuron syndrome (UMNS). Rehabilitation can provide a guide for motor recovery influencing the neurobiology of neuronal plasticity providing controlled, repetitive, and variable patterns. Increasing therapy dosage, intensity, number of repetition, execution of task-oriented exercises, and combining top-down and bottom-up approaches can promote plasticity and functional recovery. Robotic exoskeletons for upper and lower limbs, based on the principle of motor learning, have been introduced in neurorehabilitation. In this narrative review, we provide an overview of literature published on exoskeleton devices for upper and lower limb rehabilitation in patients with UMNS; we summarized the available current research evidence and outlined the new challenges that neurorehabilitation and bioengineering will have to face in the upcoming years. Robotic treatment should be considered a rehabilitation tool useful to generate a more complex, controlled multisensory stimulation of the patient and useful to modify the plasticity of neural connections through the experience of movement. Efficacy and efficiency of robotic treatment should be defined starting from intensity, complexity, and specificity of the robotic exercise, that are related to human-robot interaction in terms of motion, emotion, motivation, meaning of the task, feedback from the exoskeleton, and fine motion assistance. Duration of a single session, global period of the treatment, and the timing for beginning of robotic treatment are still open questions. There is the need to evaluate and individualize the treatment according to patient's characteristics. Robotic devices for upper and lower limbs open a window to define therapeutic modalities as possible beneficial drug, able to boost biological, neurobiological, and epigenetic changes in central nervous system. We need to implement large and innovative research programs to answer these issues in the near future.},

abstract = {Foot dimensions, indices, and variables relating to shape characteristics of foot outlines taken for Japanese, Australian aborigines, Indonesians and French were analyzed and compared with existing data to identify the differences due to growth, generation and ethnic background. The following findings were obtained: 1) There has been rapid increases in foot length for Japanese born after ca. 1950. 2) Japanese born after ca. 1960 had a smaller foot girth and foot breadth for their foot length compared to Japanese born before ca. 1950. 3) Secular change rather than aging is responsible for the generation differences in foot size and proportion. 4) Elderly female Japanese born before 1930 had very wide feet and a weaker valgus tendency of the first toe. Special attention should be paid to the needs of older men, and especially older women in the production planning and designing of the toe shapes of shoe lasts. 5) Differences due to growth and secular change in foot outflare, which is represented by posterior flexion angle of the medial axis of foot outline, were not significant. Ethnic differences in foot outflare was not significant for females. This does not appear to be easily influenced by environmental factors, such as nutritional status and shoe-wearing habits. 6) Mongoloid populations including Japanese have a wider foot for foot length compared to Caucasoid and Australoid populations. 7) East Asian populations including Japanese have a smaller foot length for height compared to Southeast Asians and Africans. The causes may be both genetic and environmental.},

abstract = {A general and comprehensive analysis on the continuous contact force models for soft materials in multibody dynamics is presented throughout this work. The force models are developed based on the foundation of the Hertz law together with a hysteresis damping parameter that accounts for the energy dissipation during the contact process. In a simple way, these contact force models are based on the analysis and development of three main issues: (i) the dissipated energy associated with the coefficient of restitution that includes the balance of kinetic energy and the conservation of the linear momentum between the initial and final instant of contact; (ii) the stored elastic energy, representing part of initial kinetic energy, which is evaluated as the work done by the contact force developed during the contact process; (iii) the dissipated energy due to internal damping, which is evaluated by modeling the contact process as a single degree-of- freedom system to obtain a hysteresis damping factor. This factor takes into account the geometrical and material properties, as well as the kinematic characteristics of the contacting bodies. This approach has the great merit that can be used for contact problems involving materials with low or moderate values of coefficient of restitution and, therefore, accommodate high amount of energy dissipation. In addition, the resulting contact force model is suitable to be included into the equations of motion of a multibody system and contributes to their stable numerical resolution. A demonstrative example of application is used to provide the results that support the analysis and discussion of procedures and methodologies described in this work. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Tests on a young healthy subject were conducted. In the case of robot completely unpowered, maximum backdriving torques were found to be in the order of 10 Nm due to the robot design features (reduced swinging masses; low intrinsic mechanical impedance and high-efficiency reduction gears for the actuators).

abstract = {Exoskeletons are a special type of collaborative robot that can be thought of as a humanoid robot clung to a human body (or a pilot). The proposed powered exoskeleton/ robot is a 3 Degree of Freedom (DoF) robot and it relies on DC motors to apply the necessary joint torques which in turn require an input to drive these motors. The idea here is to read the pilot's intention using an array of Force Sensing Resistors (FSRs) and then parsing it through a Dynamic Intention Filter (DIF), that yields a meaningful output, necessary to drive the exoskeleton. The DIF proposed here is a novel approach that serves as an intelligent element in the system; based on various inputs, the DIF intelligently controls the motors within the predefined and dynamically-changing safe limits of a typical human arm. Nested PID controllers are used to drive the exoskeleton in "torque-control" and "position-control" modes, and a comparison is made regarding their advantages and disadvantages.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the static friction properties between human palmar skin and five grabrail materials (chrome, stainless steel, power-coated steel, textured aluminium and knurled steel) for dry, wet and soapy hands. Thirty subjects (15 female, 15 male) participated in this study, their ages ranging from 19 to 45 years with a mean age of 28 years. The normal force, friction force, and coefficient of static friction were determined by measuring three-dimensional forces while slipping the palm of the hand over the surface of a grabrail. A repeated measures ANOVA indicated that gender, age, hand size and trial effect had no significant influence (p {\textgreater}0.05) on these results. The coefficient of friction (p {\textless}0.001) and friction force (p {\textless}0.001) were significantly lower when the hand was soapy than when it was dry or wet. The normal force applied when the hand was soapy was significantly greater (p {\textless}0.001) than when it was dry or wet. No significant difference was found between dry and wet hands. The two textured materials displayed superior friction properties when the hand was soapy, while the smooth materials performed best when the hand was dry.},

@article{Lobo-Prat2017,
abstract = {Background: Adults with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) can benefit from devices that actively support their arm function. A critical component of such devices is the control interface as it is responsible for the human-machine interaction. Our previous work indicated that surface electromyography (sEMG) and force-based control with active gravity and joint-stiffness compensation were feasible solutions for the support of elbow movements (one degree of freedom). In this paper, we extend the evaluation of sEMG-and force-based control interfaces to simultaneous and proportional control of planar arm movements (two degrees of freedom). Methods: Three men with DMD (18-23 years-old) with different levels of arm function (i.e. Brooke scores of 4, 5 and 6) performed a series of line-tracing tasks over a tabletop surface using an experimental active arm support. The arm movements were controlled using three control methods: sEMG-based control, force-based control with stiffness compensation (FSC), and force-based control with no compensation (FNC). The movement performance was evaluated in terms of percentage of task completion, tracing error, smoothness and speed. Results: For subject S1 (Brooke 4) FNC was the preferred method and performed better than FSC and sEMG. FNC was not usable for subject S2 (Brooke 5) and S3 (Brooke 6). Subject S2 presented significantly lower movement speed with sEMG than with FSC, yet he preferred sEMG since FSC was perceived to be too fatiguing. Subject S3 could not successfully use neither of the two force-based control methods, while with sEMG he could reach almost his entire workspace. Conclusions: Movement performance and subjective preference of the three control methods differed with the level of arm function of the participants. Our results indicate that all three control methods have to be considered in real applications, as they present complementary advantages and disadvantages. The fact that the two weaker subjects (S2 and S3) experienced the force-based control interfaces as fatiguing suggests that sEMG-based control interfaces could be a better solution for adults with DMD. Yet force-based control interfaces can be a better alternative for those cases in which voluntary forces are higher than the stiffness forces of the arms.},

abstract = {Exoskeletons and other wearable robotic devices have a wide range of potential applications, including assisting patients with walking pathologies, acting as tools for rehabilitation, and enhancing the capabilities of healthy humans. However, applying these devices effectively in a real-world setting can be challenging, as the optimal design features and control commands for an exoskeleton are highly dependent on the current user, task and environment. Consequently, robust metrics and methods for quantifying exoskeleton performance are required. This work presents an analysis of walking data collected for 7 healthy subjects walking with an active pelvis exoskeleton over three assistance scenarios and five walking contexts. Spatial and temporal, kinematic, kinetic and other novel dynamic metrics were compared to identify which metrics exhibit desirable invariance properties, and so are good candidates for use as a stability metric. Additionally, using a model-based approach, the average metabolic power consumption was calculated for a subset of muscles crossing the hip, knee and ankle joints, and used to analyse how energy-reducing properties of an exoskeleton are affected by changes in walking context. The metric results demonstrated that medial-lateral centre of pressure displacement and medial-lateral margin of stability exhibit strong invariance to changes in walking conditions. This suggests these dynamic stability metrics are optimised in human gait and are potentially suitable metrics for optimising in an exoskeleton control paradigm. The effectiveness of the exoskeleton at reducing human energy expenditure was observed to increase when walking on an incline, where muscles aiding in hip flexion were assisted, but decrease when walking at a slow speed. These results underline the need for adaptive control algorithms for exoskeletons if they are to be used in varied environments.},

abstract = {Objective: To compare the effectiveness of a temporary topical external haemostat (OMNI-STAT Granules, Omni-stat Medical Inc., US) versus the use of electrocautery for bleeding control in patients who have undergone surgical wound debridement. Time saved in the operating room (OR) was evaluated. Method: A prospective evaluation of use of a topical haemostat in an OR setting was compared with retrospective data collected using electrocautery to understand the time-saving benefits of using a topical haemostat versus electrocautery. Results: A total of 52 patients were treated with the topical haemostat, and 89 patients with electrocautery. The topical haemostat was shown to be as effective in achieving haemostasis post-surgical debridement as electrocautery, with the added benefits of significant time savings in the OR (reducing the mean total OR time by 19.1{\%}). Additionally, preprocedure and surgical procedure times in patients treated with the topical haemostat were significantly reduced. The results showed that wounds treated with the topical haemostat demonstrated a more advanced stage of healing, which may be a result of the lack of tissue damage demonstrated with the topical haemostat compared with electrocautery. Conclusion: This study found that the temporary topical haemostat was equally as effective as cauterisation in achieving haemostasis. In addition, significant saving in OR time was demonstrated relative to electrocautery. The improved OR times may translate into increased cost-effectiveness, relative to electrocautery, by increasing the number of surgical cases per day and/or using resources more effectively to treat more patients. It may also enable bleeding control in the outpatient clinic or at the bedside, freeing up costly OR time and enabling more effective management of healthcare resources.

abstract = {In the EU, lower back pain affects more than 40{\%} of the working population. Mechanical loading of the lower back has been shown to be an important risk factor. Peak mechanical load can be reduced by ergonomic interventions, the use of cranes and, more recently, by the use of exoskeletons. Despite recent advances in the development of exoskeletons for industrial applications, they are not widely adopted by industry yet. Some of the challenges, which have to be overcome are a reduced range of motion, misalignment between the human anatomy and kinematics of the exoskeleton as well as discomfort. A body of research exists on how an exoskeleton can be designed to compensate for misalignment and thereby improve comfort. However, how to design an exoskeleton that achieves a similar range of motion as a human lumbar spine of up to 60° in the sagittal plane, has not been extensively investigated. We addressed this need by developing and testing a novel passive back support exoskeleton, including a mechanism comprised of flexible beams, which run in parallel to the spine, providing a large range of motion and lowering the peak torque requirements around the lumbo-sacral (L5/S1) joint. Furthermore, we ran a pilot study to test the biomechanical (N = 2) and functional (N = 3) impact on subjects while wearing the exoskeleton. The biomechanical testing was once performed with flexible beams as a back interface and once with a rigid structure. An increase of more than 25{\%} range of motion of the trunk in the sagittal plane was observed by using the flexible beams. The pilot functional tests, which are compared to results from a previous study with the Laevo device, suggest, that the novel exoskeleton is perceived as less hindering in almost all tested tasks.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to present a concept of human-robot- interaction control for robots with compliant pneumatic soft-actuators which are directly attached to the human body. Backdrivability of this type of actuators is beneficial for comfort and safety and they are well suitable to design rehabilitation robots for training of activities of daily living (ADL). The concept is verified with an application example of sit-to-stand tasks taking conventional treatment in neurology as reference. The focus is on stroke patients with a target group suffering from hemiplegia and paralysis in one half of the body. A 2 DOF exoskeleton robot was used as testbed to implement the control concept for supporting rising based on a master-slave position control such that movements from the fit leg are transferred to the affected leg. Furthermore the wearer of the robot has the possibility to adjust support for stabilizing the knee joint manually. Preliminary results are presented. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper presents the mechanical design and evaluation of a knee–ankle–foot robot, which is compact, modular and portable for stroke patients to carry out overground gait training at outpatient and home settings. A novel compact series elastic actuator (SEA) is developed for safe human–robot interactions. As a solution to the limitation of conventional SEA designs, one low-stiffness translational spring and a high-stiffness torsion spring are placed in series for force transmission. The springs are selected based on gait biomechanics to maintain a high intrinsic compliance for most period of a gait cycle, while retaining the capacity to provide the peak force. To achieve portability, the robotic joint mechanism is optimized based on gait biomechanics, and the mechanical structure is built with lightweight materials. This robot demonstrates stable and accurate force control in experiments conducted on healthy subjects with overground walking. The activation level of the major leg muscles of subjects is reduced as indicated by the EMG signals and the normal gait pattern is maintained during the test, which demonstrates that the robot can provide effective assistive force to the subjects during overground walking.},

abstract = {Gait analysis on the treadmill and in the overground condition is used both in scientific approaches for investigating the neuronal organisation and ontogenetic development of locomotion and in a variety of clinical applications. We investigated the differences between overground and treadmill locomotion (at identical gait velocity) in 12 adults and 14 children (6-7 years old). During treadmill locomotion the step frequency increased by 7{\%} in adults and 10{\%} in children compared to overground walking, whereas the stride length and the stance phase of the walking cycle decreased. The swing phase, however, increased significantly by 5{\%} in adults and remained unchanged in children. Balance-related gait parameters such as the step width and foot rotation angles increased during treadmill locomotion. The reduction of the step length was found to be stable after 10 min of treadmill walking in most subjects. With regard to the shift phases of the walking cycle and the changed balance related gait parameters in the condition, we assume a different modulation of the central pattern generator in treadmill walking, due to a changed afferent input. Regarding the pronounced differences between overground and treadmill walking in children, it is discussed whether the systems generating and integrating different modulations of locomotion into a stable movement pattern have reached full capacity in 6-7 years old children.},

abstract = {Musculoskeletal models provide a noninvasive means to study human movement and predict the effects of interventions on gait. Our goal was to create an open-source 3-D musculoskeletal model with high-fidelity representations of the lower limb musculature of healthy young individuals that can be used to generate accurate simulations of gait. Methods: Our model includes bony geometry for the full body, 37 degrees of freedom to define joint kinematics, Hill-type models of 80 muscle-tendon units actuating the lower limbs, and 17 ideal torque actuators driving the upper body. The model's musculotendon parameters are derived from previous anatomical measurements of 21 cadaver specimens and magnetic resonance images of 24 young healthy subjects. We tested the model by evaluating its computational time and accuracy of simulations of healthy walking and running. Results: Generating muscle-driven simulations of normal walking and running took approximately 10 minutes on a typical desktop computer. The differences between our muscle-generated and inverse dynamics joint moments were within 3{\%} (RMSE) of the peak inverse dynamics joint moments in both walking and running, and our simulated muscle activity showed qualitative agreement with salient features from experimental electromyography data. Conclusion: These results suggest that our model is suitable for generating muscle-driven simulations of healthy gait.We encourage other researchers to further validate and apply the model to study other motions of the lower extremity. Significance: The model is implemented in the open-source software platform OpenSim. Themodel and data used to create and test the simulations are freely available at https://simtk.org/home/full{\_}body/, allowing others to reproduce these results and create their own simulations.},

The exoskeleton consists of an anatomical shoulder mechanism with five active degrees of freedom, and one degree of freedom elbow and wrist mechanisms powered by series elastic actuators. The dynamic model of the exoskeleton is formulated using a recursive Newton-Euler algorithm with spatial dynamics representation. A baseline control algorithm is developed to achieve dynamic transparency and scapulohumeral rhythm assistance, and the coupled stability of the robot-human system at the baseline control is investigated. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the kinematic and dynamic characteristics of the exoskeleton. The results show that the exoskeleton exhibits good kinematic compatibility to the human body with a wide range of motion and performs task-space force and impedance control behaviors reliably.},

abstract = {Human-robot cooperation is vital for optimising powered assist of lower limb exoskeletons (LLEs). Robotic capacity to intelligently adapt to human force, however, demands a fusion of data from exoskeleton and user state for smooth human-robot synergy. Muscle activity, mapped through electromyography (EMG) or mechanomyography (MMG) is widely acknowledged as usable sensor input that precedes the onset of human joint torque. However, competing and complementary information between such physiological feedback is yet to be exploited, or even assessed, for predictive LLE control. We investigate complementary and competing benefits of EMG and MMG sensing modalities as a means of calculating human torque input for assist-as-needed (AAN) LLE control. Three biomechanically agnostic machine learning approaches, linear regression, polynomial regression, and neural networks, are implemented for joint torque prediction during human-exoskeleton interaction experiments. Results demonstrate MMG predicts human joint torque with slightly lower accuracy than EMG for isometric human-exoskeleton interaction. Performance is comparable for dynamic exercise. Neural network models achieve the best performance for both MMG and EMG (94.8{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.7{\%} with MMG and 97.6{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.8{\%} with EMG (Mean {\$}\backslashpm{\$} SD)) at the expense of training time and implementation complexity. This investigation represents the first MMG human joint torque models for LLEs and their first comparison with EMG. We provide our implementations for future investigations (https://github.com/cic12/ieee{\_}appx).},

The overall performance depends on many factors including selection of architecture, device, parameters and the nature of the coupling to the human, offering numerous challenges to design- evaluation and refinement. In this paper, we discuss merger of techniques from the musculoskeletal analysis and simulation-based design to study and analyze the performance of such exoskeletons. A representative example of a simplified exoskeleton interacting with and assisting the human arm is used to illustrate principal ideas. Overall, four different case-scenarios are developed and examined with quantitative performance measures to evaluate the effectiveness of the design and allow for design refinement. The results show that augmentation by way of the exoskeleton can lead to a significant reduction in muscle loading. INTRODUCTION},

abstract = {In minimally invasive surgery (MIS) the continuously increasing use of robotic devices allows surgical operations to be conducted more precisely and more efficiently. Safe and accurate interaction between robot instruments and living tissue is an important issue for both successful operation and patient safety. Human tissue, which is generally viscoelastic, nonlinear and anisotropic, is often described as purely elastic for its simplicity in contact force control design and online computation. However, the elastic model cannot reproduce the complex properties of a real tissue. Based on in vitro animal tissue relaxation tests, we identify the Hunt-Crossley viscoelastic model as the most realistic one to describe the soft tissue's mechanical behavior among several candidate models. A force control method based on Hunt-Crossley model is developed following the state feedback design technique with a Kalman filter based active observer (AOB). Both simulation and experimental studies were carried out to verify the performance of developed force controller, comparing with other linear viscoelastic and elastic model based force controllers. The studies and comparisons show that the Hunt-Crossley model based force controller ensures comparable rise time in transient response as the controller based on Kelvin-Boltzmann model which is reported as the most accurate description for robot-tissue interaction in recent literature, but it causes much less overshoot and remains stable for tasks with faster response time requirements.},

This takes the effect of DOF at human elbow and wrist of the upper limb. Dexterity of the manipulator is measured using manipulability index and minimum singular value. All measures are based on Jacobian of the manipulator. This four DOF manipulator is then modified by adding two more degrees of freedom to make total of six. Therefore with respect to task defined in operational space; modified exoskeleton manipulator operates as redundant. Manipulability index and minimum singular value are again determined for six degree of freedom modified exoskeleton manipulator. The effect of redundancy in order to improve the manipulation in upper limb exoskeleton robot is investigated in this study.},

This paper aims to provide a systematic overview and evaluation of existing bilateral upper-limb rehabilitation devices and robots based on their mechanisms and clinical-outcomes. Most of the articles studied here were searched from nine online databases and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) from year 1993 to 2015. Devices and robots were categorized as end-effectors, exoskeletons and industrial robots. Totally ten end-effectors, one exoskeleton and one industrial robot were evaluated in terms of their mechanical characteristics, degrees of freedom (DOF), supported control modes, clinical applicability and outcomes. Preliminary clinical results of these studies showed that all participants could gain certain improvements in terms of range of motion, strength or physical function after training. Only four studies supported that bilateral training was better than unilateral training. However, most of clinical results cannot definitely verify the effectiveness of mechanisms and clinical protocols used in robotic therapies. To explore the actual value of these robots and devices, further research on ingenious mechanisms, dose-matched clinical protocols and universal evaluation criteria should be conducted in the future.},

abstract = {Different models have been used in the literature for the simulation of surface contact in biomechanical knee models. However, there is a lack of systematic comparisons of these models applied to the simulation of a common case, which will provide relevant information about their accuracy and suitability for application in models of the implanted knee. In this work a comparison of the Hertz model (HM), the elastic foundation model (EFM) and the finite element model (FEM) for the simulation of the elastic contact in a 3D model of the prosthetic knee is presented. From the results of this comparison it is found that although the nature of the EFM offers advantages when compared with that of the HM for its application to realistic prosthetic surfaces, and when compared with the FEM in CPU time, its predictions can differ from FEM in some circumstances. These differences are considerable if the comparison is performed for prescribed displacements, although they are less important for prescribed loads. To solve these problems a new modified elastic foundation model (mEFM) is proposed that maintains basically the simplicity of the original model while producing much more accurate results. In this paper it is shown that this new mEFM calculates pressure distribution and contact area with accuracy and short computation times for toroidal contacting surfaces. Although further work is needed to confirm its validity for more complex geometries the mEFM is envisaged as a good option for application in 3D knee models to predict prosthetic knee performance. {\textcopyright} 2007 IPEM.},

SETTING: Patient-level longitudinal data on 34 787 encounters from an academic hospital electronic health record (EHR) between 2011 and 2014, including daily Braden scores.

PARTICIPANTS: Hospitalised adults with Braden scores classified into five risk levels: very high risk (6-9), high risk (10-11), moderate risk (12-14), at-risk (15-18), minimal risk (19-23). INTERVENTIONS: Standard care, repeated risk assessment in all risk levels or only repeated risk assessment in high-risk strata based on machine-learning simulations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs (2016 {\$}US) of pressure-injury treatment and prevention, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) related to pressure injuries were weighted by transition probabilities to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) at {\$}100 000/QALY willingness-to-pay. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses tested model uncertainty. RESULTS: Simulating prevention for all patients yielded greater QALYs at higher cost from societal and healthcare sector perspectives, equating to ICERs of {\$}2000/QALY and {\$}2142/QALY, respectively. Risk-stratified follow-up in patients with Braden scores {\textless}15 dominated standard care. Prevention for all patients was cost-effective in {\textgreater}99{\%} of probabilistic simulations. CONCLUSION: Our analysis using EHR data maintains that pressure-injury prevention for all inpatients is cost-effective. Hospitals should invest in nursing compliance with international prevention guidelines.},

abstract = {Knee exoskeletons have been increasingly applied as assistive devices to help lower-extremity impaired people to make their knee joints move through providing external movement compensation. Tracking control of knee exoskeletons guided by human intentions often encounters time-varying (time-dependent) issues and the disturbance interaction torque, which may dramatically put an influence up on their dynamic behaviors. Inertial and viscous parameters of knee exoskeletons can be estimated to be time-varying due to unexpected mechanical vibrations and contact interactions. Moreover, the interaction torque produced from knee joint of wearers has an evident disturbance effect on regular motions of knee exoskeleton. All of these points can increase difficultly of accurate control of knee exoskeletons to follow desired joint angle trajectories. This paper proposes a novel control strategy for controlling knee exoskeleton with time-varying inertial and viscous coefficients disturbed by interaction torque. Such designed controller is able to make the tracking error of joint angle of knee exoskeletons exponentially converge to zero. Meanwhile, the proposed approach is robust to guarantee the tracking error bounded when the interaction torque exists. Illustrative simulation and experiment results are presented to show efficiency of the proposed controller. Additionally, comparisons with gradient dynamic (GD) approach and other methods are also presented to demonstrate efficiency and superiority of the proposed control strategy for tracking joint angle of knee exoskeleton.},

abstract = {One of the critical aspects in the design of an assistive wearable robot
is the energy efficiency of the actuation system, sinceit significantly
affects the weight and consequently the comfort of the system. Several
strategies have been used in previous research, mostly based on energy
harvesting, compliant elements for mechanical energy accumulation
(springs or elastic cords), ratchets, and clutches. However, the design
of the optimal actuator arrangement is highly dependent on the task,
which increases significantly the complexity of the design process. In
this letter, we present an energy efficiency analysis and design
optimization of an actuation system applied to a soft module lower limb
exoskeleton. Instead of performing a comparison between predefined
mechanism arrangements, we solve a full optimization problem that
includes not only the mechanism parameters, but also the mechanism
architecture itself. The optimization is performed for a walking task
using gait data from a stroke subject, and the result is a set of
actuator arrangements with optimal parameters for the analyzed task and
selected user. The optimized mechanism is able to reduce the energy
requirements by 20-65{\%}, depending on the joint. The proposed mechanism
is currently under development within the XoSoft EU project, a modular
soft lower-limb exoskeleton to assist people with mobility impairments.},

abstract = {A new frontier of assistive devices aims at designing exoskeletons based on fabric and flexible materials for applications where kinematic transparency is the primary requirement. Bowden-cable transmission is the widely employed solution in most of the aforementioned applications due to advantages in durability, lightweight, safety, and flexibility. The major advantages of soft assistive devices driven by bowden-cable transmissions can be identified in the superior ergonomics and wearability, allowing users to freely move and allocating the actuation stages far from the end-effector. However, control accuracy in bowden-cable transmission presents some intrinsic limitation due to nonlinearities such as static and dynamic friction, occurring between the cables and the bowden sheaths, and backlash hysteresis. Friction and backlash effects are known to be related to the curvature of the flexible sheath, which is not directly measurable and can vary during human motion. In this paper we describe our new wearable exosuit for upper limb assistance and in particular we introduce a mathematical model for backlash hysteresis compensation. The implementation of a nonlinear adaptive controller is described in detail and experimentally tested on the proposed design as a backlash compensation strategy: results report that the adaptive controller improves the accuracy in position tracking (i.e. RMSE in trajectory tracking ≈1∘) by compensating for time-varying backlash and continuously updating the model parameters. The backlash hysteresis model and the proposed control scheme are validated first on a custom-designed test bench and then applied to control the soft exoskeleton worn by a subject affected by bilateral brachial plexus injury.},

METHODS: Data in this report are from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), which was conducted on a complex, stratified, multistage probability sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population. A total of 31,241 persons were examined. The anthropometric measurements taken included weight, height, recumbent length, circumferences, limb lengths, joint breadths, and skinfold thicknesses. Body mass index values were computed from measured height and weight values. RESULTS: The tables in this report include weighted population means, standard errors of the means, and selected percentiles of body measurement values. Because measurements varied by sex and age (and by race and ethnicity in adults), results are reported by these subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: These data add to the knowledge about trends in child growth and development and are useful in monitoring overweight and obesity in the U.S. population.},

@article{Toxiri2019a,
abstract = {Background: The large prevalence and risk of occupational lower-back pain and injury associated with manual material handling activities has raised interest in novel technical solutions. Wearable back-support exoskeletons promise to improve ergonomics by reducing the loading on the lumbar spine. Purpose: Since many new prototypes and products are being developed, this article presents an up-to-date overview of the different technologies. By discussing the corresponding advantages and drawbacks, the objective is to promote awareness and communication among developers, ergonomics practitioners, customers, and factory workers. Methods: The state-of-the-art is presented with a focus on three technological aspects: (i) the actuators generating assistive forces/torques, with a main distinction between passive and active devices; (ii) the structures and physical attachments that transfer those forces/torques to the user, with structures being soft, rigid, or a combination of the two; and (iii) the control strategies employed (i.e., how devices adjust assistive forces/torques to accommodate different activities and parameters). Discussion: The choice of actuation technology may determine the applicability of a device to different scenarios. Passive exoskeletons appear more suitable for tasks requiring relatively light assistance and little dynamic movements. By contrast, heavier and more dynamic tasks will justify the use of more complex active exoskeletons. While on- board battery power is increasingly present on active exoskeletons, the tradeoff between power autonomy and additional battery mass will probably depend on the specific application. Most back-support exoskeletons are implemented using rigid articulated structures, which tend to be heavy and bulky, but generate more appropriate patterns of forces. Fewer soft exoskeletons have been developed to date, although they could be integrated with or worn underneath standard working attire and offer greater user comfort. The adoption of any given device will ultimately depend on several factors, including user acceptance and the costs and benefits associated with specific applications.

abstract = {Tendon drives are widely used in robotics. The compliance of the tendon in such drives suits them for soft robots, including soft wearable robots, but several issues impede their use. Generally, the tendon should always maintain tension to prevent derailment from the spool. However, in soft robots, tendon tension induces high friction forces owing to the absence of ball bearings. Because the kinematics of the soft robot is basically nonlinear and changed by the deformation of the structure, the kinematic difference between the soft structure and the spool causes derailment of the tendon. Moreover, continuously maintained tension in soft wearable robots causes safety issues. The linear actuator can be an option. However, the need to increase the length of the linear actuator to accommodate the excursion length of its tendon is a barrier to its use in small-scale applications. To preclude this issue, a slack-enabling actuator that employs a spool is proposed. The space efficiency of the spool enables the mechanism to be small, and a one-way clutch applies unidirectional friction force to the tendon to tighten the tendon around the spool. This paper describes the design concept for the slack-enabling mechanism, its design optimization, and system identification for force control.},

abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide insight into ongoing cognitive and affective processes and are commonly used for direct control of human-machine systems (Vidal, 1973). Recently, a different type of BCI has emerged (Cutrell and Tan, 2008; and Zander et al., 2008), which instead focuses solely on the non-intrusive recognition of mental state elicited by a given primary human-machine interaction. These so-called passive BCIs (pBCIs) do, by their nature, not disturb the primary interaction, and thus allow for enhancement of human-machine systems with relatively low usage cost (Roetting et al., 2009; and Zander et al., 2008), especially in conjunction with gel-free sensors. Here, we apply pBCIs to detect cognitive processes containing covert user states, which are difficult to access with conventional exogenous measures. We present two variants of a task inspired by an erroneously adapting human-machine system, a scenario important in automated adaptation. In this context, we derive two related, yet complementary, applications of pBCIs. First, we show that pBCIs are capable of detecting a covert user state related to the perception of loss of control over a system. The detection is realized by exploiting non-stationarities induced by the loss of control. Second, we show that pBCIs can be used to detect a covert user state directly correlated to the user's interpretation of erroneous actions of the machine. We then demonstrate the use of this information to enhance the interaction between the user and the machine, in an experiment outside the laboratory.},

The prosthesis attempts to produce a natural level ground walking gait that approximates the joint torques and kinematics of a non-amputee while maintaining compliant joints, which has the potential to decrease impulsive losses, and ultimately reduce the end user energy consumption. This first prototype consists of a passive knee and an active ankle which are energetically coupled to reduce the total power consumption of the device. Here we present simulations of the actuation system of the ankle and the passive behavior of the knee module with and without the energy transfer effects, the mechanical design of the prosthesis, and empirical results from testing of the physical device with amputee subjects.},

abstract = {The increasing use of soft materials in robotics applications requires the development of mathematical models to describe their viscoelastic and nonlinear properties. The traditional linear viscoelastic models are unable to describe nonlinear strain-dependent behaviors. This limitation has been addressed by implementing a piecewise linearization (PL) in the simplest viscoelastic model, the Standard Linear Solid (SLS). In this work, we aim to implement the PL in a more complex model, the Wiechert model and compare the stress response of both linearized models. Therefore, the experimental data from the stress relaxation and tensile strength tests of six rubber-based materials is used to approximate the spring and dashpot constants of the SLS and the Wiechert model. Prior to implement the PL into the stress-strain curve of each material, the stress response from the Maxwell branches must be subtracted from this curve. By using the parameters obtained from fitting the Wiechert model into the stress relaxation curve, the response of both linearized models was improved. Due to the selection of constitutive equations evaluated, the linearized SLS model described the stress-strain curve more accurately. Finally, this work describes in details every step of the fitting process and highlights the benefits of using linearization methods to improve known models as an alternative of using highly complex models to describe the mechanical properties of soft materials.},

To show that local reduction of VEGF within the kidney is sufficient to trigger the pathogenesis of thrombotic microangiopathy, we used conditional gene targeting to delete VEGF from renal podocytes in adult mice; this resulted in a profound thrombotic glomerular injury. These observations provide evidence that glomerular injury in patients who are treated with bevacizumab is probably due to direct targeting of VEGF by antiangiogenic therapy.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE. For stroke survivors and many other people with upper-extremity impairment, daily life can be difficult without properly functioning arms. Some modern physical therapy exercises focus on rehabilitating people with these troubles by correcting patients' perceptions of their own body to eventually regain complete control and strength over their arms again. Augmentative wearable robots, such as the upper-extremity exoskeletons and exosuits, may be able to assist in this endeavor. A common drawback in many of these exoskeletons, however, is their inability to conform to the natural flexibility of the human body without a rigid base. We have built one such exosuit to address this challenge: Compliant Robotic Upper-extremity eXosuit (CRUX). This robot is a compliant, lightweight, multi-DoF, portable exosuit that affords its wearer the ability to augment themselves in many unconventional settings (i.e. outside of a clinic). These attributes are largely achieved by using a modified tensegrity design situated according to measured lines of minimal-extension, where a network of tension members provide a foundation to apply augmentative forces via precisely placed power-lines. In this paper, we detail the design process of CRUX, the report on CRUX's prototypical composition, and describe the mimetic control algorithm used. We also discuss the results of three studies that illustrate the efficacy of CRUX's mimetic controller, CRUX's flexibility and compliance, and the metabolic cost reduction when users exercise with assistance from CRUX as opposed to without. We conclude this paper with a summary of our findings, potential use cases for this technology, and the direction of future related work.},

abstract = {The increasing use of soft materials in robotics applications requires the development of mathematical models to describe their viscoelastic and nonlinear properties. The traditional linear viscoelastic models are unable to describe nonlinear strain-dependent behaviors. This limitation has been addressed by implementing a piecewise linearization (PL) in the simplest viscoelastic model, the Standard Linear Solid (SLS). In this work, we aim to implement the PL in a more complex model, the Wiechert model and compare the stress response of both linearized models. Therefore, the experimental data from the stress relaxation and tensile strength tests of six rubber-based materials is used to approximate the spring and dashpot constants of the SLS and the Wiechert model. Prior to implement the PL into the stress-strain curve of each material, the stress response from the Maxwell branches must be subtracted from this curve. By using the parameters obtained from fitting the Wiechert model into the stress relaxation curve, the response of both linearized models was improved. Due to the selection of constitutive equations evaluated, the linearized SLS model described the stress-strain curve more accurately. Finally, this work describes in details every step of the fitting process and highlights the benefits of using linearization methods to improve known models as an alternative of using highly complex models to describe the mechanical properties of soft materials.},

abstract = {Soft exoskeletons apply compressive forces at the limbs via connection cuffs to actuate movement or stabilise joints. To avoid excessive mechanical loading, the interface with the wearer's body needs to be carefully designed. The purpose of this study was to establish the magnitude of circumferential compression at the lower limb during walking that causes discomfort/pain. It was hypothesized that the thresholds differ from those during standing. A cohort of 21 healthy participants were tested using two sizes of pneumatic cuffs, inflated at the thigh and calf in a tonic or phasic manner. The results showed lower inflation pressures triggering discomfort/pain at the thigh, with tonic compression, and wider pneumatic cuffs. The thresholds were lower during walking than standing still. Deep tissue oxygenation increased during phasic compression and decreased during tonic compression. According to the findings, circumferential compression by soft exoskeletons is preferably applied at anatomical sites with smaller volumes of soft tissue, using narrow connection cuffs and inflation pressures below 14 kPa.},

abstract = {Recent studies of sprinters and distance runners have suggested that variations in human foot proportions and plantarflexor muscle moment arm correspond to the level of sprint performance or running economy. Less clear, however, is whether differences in muscle moment arm are mediated by altered tendon paths or by variation in the centre of ankle joint rotation. Previous measurements of these differences have relied upon assumed joint centres and measurements of bone geometry made externally, such that they would be affected by the thickness of the overlying soft tissue. Using magnetic resonance imaging, we found that trained sprinters have shorter plantarflexor moment arms (p = 0.011) and longer forefoot bones (p = 0.019) than non-sprinters. The shorter moment arms of sprinters are attributable to differences in the location of the centre of rotation (p{\textless}0.001) rather than to differences in the path of the Achilles tendon. A simple computer model suggests that increasing the ratio of forefoot to rearfoot length permits more plantarflexor muscle work during plantarflexion that occurs at rates expected during the acceleration phase following the sprint start. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Robotics provides the basic know-how on the foundations of robotics: modelling, planning and control. The text develops around a core of consistent and rigorous formalism with fundamental and technological material giving rise naturally and with gradually increasing difficulty to more advanced considerations. The theory of manipulator structures presented in the early part of the book encompasses: • the fundamentals: kinematics, statics and trajectory planning; and • the technology of actuators, sensors and control units. Subsequently, more advanced instruction is given in: • dynamics and motion control of robot manipulators; • environmental interaction using exteroceptive sensory data (force and vision); • mobile robots; and • motion planning. Appendices ensure that students will have access to a consistent level of background in basic areas such as rigid-body mechanics, feedback control, and others. Problems are raised and the proper tools established to find engineering-oriented solutions rather than to focus on abstruse theoretical methodology. To impart practical skill, more than 60 examples and case studies are carefully worked out and interwoven through the text, with frequent resort to simulation. In addition, nearly 150 end-of-chapter problems are proposed, and the book is accompanied by a pdf solutions manual and MATLAB{\textregistered} code for computer problems; these are available free of charge to those adopting Robotics as a textbook for courses. This text is suitable for use in senior undergraduate and graduate courses in automation and computer, electrical, electronic and mechanical engineering courses with strong robotics content.},

Past studies have developed a muscle-force control method with very strict limitations on the conditions. These conditions will be removed, and the problem will be reformulated as a constrained optimization of several parameters. The optimization algorithm recognizes when a solution to the muscle control problem cannot be exactly realized, and finds the solution that minimizes the mean errors of the individual muscles between expected and desired muscle activation. This is demonstrated in a computer simulation of human arm dynamics and compared against the prior method to demonstrate its wider applicability. In addition, the control method is extended to resolve issues associated with a nonideal exoskeleton with incomplete torque application to the joints. A quasi-optimized motor-task that minimizes the errors in target muscles and nontarget muscles can be obtained. This paper presents theoretical analysis, simulation, and experimental results on the performance of the relaxed individual muscle control.},

@article{Dumas2014,
abstract = {While reconstructing skeletal movement using stereophotogrammetry, the relative movement between a skin marker and the underlying bone is regarded as an artefact (soft tissue artefact: STA). Similarly, the consequent pose, size and shape variations that affect a cluster of markers associated with a bony segment, or any arbitrary change of configuration in the marker local positions as representative of the skin envelope shape variation, may also be looked upon as an STA. Bone pose estimators able to compensate for these artefacts must embed relevant a priori knowledge in the form of an STA mathematical model. Prior to tackling this modeling exercise, an appropriate definition and mathematical representation of the STA time histories must be accomplished. Relevant appropriateness is based on the degree of approximation of the STA reconstruction and on the number of parameters involved.The objective of this study was to propose a generalized mathematical representation of the STA which would be applicable for most plausible definitions of it. To this purpose, a modal approach was used that, most importantly, allows for the splitting of a given STA into additive components (modes). For each STA definition, these modes may be ranked according to the contribution that each of them gives to the reconstruction of the STA. In this way, the STA definition leading to the minimum number of modes, and, therefore, of parameters, that provides an adequate approximation for further purposes can be selected, allowing a trade-off between complexity and effectiveness of the STA model.Using information available in the literature and data provided by an ex-vivo experiment, it is shown that the modes corresponding to the different STA definitions (individual marker displacements, marker-cluster geometrical transformations, and skin envelope shape variations) can be ranked and selected leading, respectively, to a large, moderate or low number of parameters embedded in the STA mathematical representation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Ground reaction forces and moments (GRF{\&}M) are important measures used as input in biomechanical analysis to estimate joint kinetics, which often are used to infer information for many musculoskeletal diseases. Their assessment is conventionally achieved using laboratory-based equipment that cannot be applied in daily life monitoring. In this study, we propose a method to predict GRF{\&}M during walking, using exclusively kinematic information from fully-ambulatory inertial motion capture (IMC). From the equations of motion, we derive the total external forces and moments. Then, we solve the indeterminacy problem during double stance using a distribution algorithm based on a smooth transition assumption. The agreement between the IMC-predicted and reference GRF{\&}M was categorized over normal walking speed as excellent for the vertical ($\rho$ = 0.992, rRMSE = 5.3{\%}), anterior ($\rho$ = 0.965, rRMSE = 9.4{\%}) and sagittal ($\rho$ = 0.933, rRMSE = 12.4{\%}) GRF{\&}M components and as strong for the lateral ($\rho$ = 0.862, rRMSE = 13.1{\%}), frontal ($\rho$ = 0.710, rRMSE = 29.6{\%}), and transverse GRF{\&}M ($\rho$ = 0.826, rRMSE = 18.2{\%}). Sensitivity analysis was performed on the effect of the cut-off frequency used in the filtering of the input kinematics, as well as the threshold velocities for the gait event detection algorithm. This study was the first to use only inertial motion capture to estimate 3D GRF{\&}M during gait, providing comparable accuracy with optical motion capture prediction. This approach enables applications that require estimation of the kinetics during walking outside the gait laboratory.},

abstract = {Musculoskeletal simulations are used in many different applications, ranging from the design of wearable robots that interact with humans to the analysis of patients with impaired movement. Here, we introduce OpenSim Moco, a software toolkit for optimizing the motion and control of musculoskeletal models built in the OpenSim modeling and simulation package. OpenSim Moco uses the direct collocation method, which is often faster and can handle more diverse problems than other methods for musculoskeletal simulation. Moco frees researchers from implementing direct collocation themselves—which typically requires extensive technical expertise—and allows them to focus on their scientific questions. The software can handle a wide range of problems that interest biomechanists, including motion tracking, motion prediction, parameter optimization, model fitting, electromyography-driven simulation, and device design. Moco is the first musculoskeletal direct collocation tool to handle kinematic constraints, which enable modeling of kinematic loops (e.g., cycling models) and complex anatomy (e.g., patellar motion). To show the abilities of Moco, we first solved for muscle activity that produced an observed walking motion while minimizing squared muscle excitations and knee joint loading. Next, we predicted how muscle weakness may cause deviations from a normal walking motion. Lastly, we predicted a squat-to-stand motion and optimized the stiffness of an assistive device placed at the knee. We designed Moco to be easy to use, customizable, and extensible, thereby accelerating the use of simulations to understand the movement of humans and other animals.},

abstract = {As a walking assistive device, one of major goals should be reduce wearer's metabolic cost as much as possible. Toward this goal, this paper presents the preliminary study on a new soft wearable robotic suit for ankle and hip assistance for daily life activities. The presented robotic suit is lightweight, and it almost does not restrict the lower limb motion range. In addition, its structure is simple, and thus wearers can easily take the device on and off by themselves. Experimental results on two young subjects show that the robotic suit reduced metabolic cost with averaged reductions of 10.2 {\%} and 6.8 {\%}, respectively, by not drastically disrupting the normal walking biomechanics of the subjects.},

abstract = {Abstract Recent clinical research has generated interest in the use of sacral wound dressings as preventive devices for patients at risk of ulceration. This study was conducted to identify the modes of action through which dressings can add to pressure ulcer prevention, for example, shear and friction force redistribution and pressure distribution. Bench testing was performed using nine commercially available dressings. The use of dressings can reduce the amplitude of shear stress and friction reaching the skin of patients at risk. They can also effectively redirect these forces to wider areas which minimises the mechanical loads upon skeletal prominences. Dressings can redistribute pressure based upon their effective Poisson ratio and larger deflection areas, providing greater load redistribution.},

A single-degree-of-freedom extender has been built for theoretical and experimental verification of the extender dynamics and control. System performance is defined as amplification of human force. It is shown that the greater the required amplification, the smaller the stability range of the system is.

abstract = {We developed a powered ankle–foot orthosis that uses artificial pneumatic muscles to produce active plantar flexor torque. The purpose of this study was to quantify the mechanical performance of the orthosis during human walking. Three subjects walked at a range of speeds wearing ankle–foot orthoses with either one or two artificial muscles working in parallel. The orthosis produced similar total peak plantar flexor torque and network across speeds independent of the number of muscles used. The orthosis generated ∼57{\%} of the peak ankle plantar flexor torque during stance and performed ∼70{\%} of the positive plantar flexor work done during normal walking. Artificial muscle bandwidth and force–length properties were the two primary factors limiting torque production. The lack of peak force and work differences between single and double muscle conditions can be explained by force–length properties. Subjects altered their ankle kinematics between conditions resulting in changes in artificial muscle length. In the double muscle condition greater plantar flexion yielded shorter artificial muscles lengths and decreased muscle forces. This finding emphasizes the importance of human testing in the design and development of robotic exoskeleton devices for assisting human movement. The results of this study outline the mechanical performance limitations of an ankle–foot orthosis powered by artificial pneumatic muscles. This orthosis could be valuable for gait rehabilitation and for studies investigating neuromechanical control of human walking.},

abstract = {Background: Carrying load alters normal walking, imposes additional stress to the musculoskeletal system, and results in an increase in energy consumption and a consequent earlier onset of fatigue. This phenomenon is largely due to increased work requirements in lower extremity joints, in turn requiring higher muscle activation. The aim of this work was to assess the biomechanical and physiological effects of a multi-joint soft exosuit that applies assistive torques to the biological hip and ankle joints during loaded walking. Methods: The exosuit was evaluated under three conditions: powered (EXO-ON), unpowered (EXO-OFF) and unpowered removing the equivalent mass of the device (EXO-OFF-EMR). Seven participants walked on an instrumented split-belt treadmill and carried a load equivalent to 30 {\%} their body mass. We assessed their metabolic cost of walking, kinetics, kinematics, and lower limb muscle activation using a portable gas analysis system, motion capture system, and surface electromyography. Results: Our results showed that the exosuit could deliver controlled forces to a wearer. Net metabolic power in the EXO-ON condition (7.5 ± 0.6 W kg-1) was 7.3 ± 5.0 {\%} and 14.2 ± 6.1 {\%} lower than in the EXO-OFF-EMR condition (7.9 ± 0.8 W kg-1; p = 0.027) and in the EXO-OFF condition (8.5 ± 0.9 W kg-1; p = 0.005), respectively. The exosuit also reduced the total joint positive biological work (sum of hip, knee and ankle) when comparing the EXO-ON condition (1.06 ± 0.16 J kg-1) with respect to the EXO-OFF condition (1.28 ± 0.26 J kg-1; p = 0.020) and to the EXO-OFF-EMR condition (1.22 ± 0.21 J kg-1; p = 0.007). Conclusions: The results of the present work demonstrate for the first time that a soft wearable robot can improve walking economy. These findings pave the way for future assistive devices that may enhance or restore gait in other applications.},

abstract = {Background: Decubitus ulcers (pressure ulcers) are localized areas of tissue breakdown in the skin and the underlying regions. Decubitus ulcers affect approximately 3 million people in the USA every year, including seniors, individuals with diabetes, and those who spend long periods in wheelchairs. Experimental studies demonstrate that static or dynamic normal loads cause blood occlusion in the skin, while prolonged loading conditions can result in skin damage. However, few studies report the effects of 'normal and shear' combined loading on blood perfusion. The goal of this research was to study alterations of transcutaneous oxygen levels and blood perfusion in human skin when both normal and shear loads were applied. Methods: Fifteen human subjects were evaluated under seven different conditions for changes in transcutaneous oxygen and blood perfusion levels during applications of normal and shear loading on the forearm. Transcutaneous oxygen levels and blood perfusion were continuously measured using a Laser Doppler system, while applied forces were quantified with a multi-axis load cell. Findings: Transcutaneous oxygen and blood perfusion levels decreased when shear loads were applied in addition to normal loads. Further, blood perfusion during recovery periods increased gradually from the first to the last test condition. Interpretation: Results indicate that adding shear loads decreased transcutaneous oxygen and blood perfusion levels in the skin. Based on these findings, shear force may play a role in skin damage, and both shear and normal loads should be considered when trying to prevent ulcer development. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Results show the accuracy of the system, where the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the POF-IMU sensor system and the encoder was below 4° in the worst case and about 1° in the best case. Then, the POF-IMU sensor system was evaluated as a wearable sensor for knee joint angle assessment without the exoskeleton, where its suitability for this purpose was demonstrated.

In present study, we examined the prevalence of pressure ulcer and some related risk factors among critically ill patients who were admitted to open heart surgery intensive care unit. Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted in ran in 2016. With using sampling formula, 82 patients that were eligible patients were selected. Patients' skins were assessed using pressure ulcer staging system developed by National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) before the operation, in time of cardiac intensive care unit admission and one times per day to patients discharge. Demographics check list and Braden scale also completed for each patient. Results: The mean age of patients was 60.9±10.5. Of them, 46 (56.1{\%}) were male and the rest were female. From the 82 patients that participated in present study, 27 (32.9{\%}) patients developed pressure ulcer (mostly stage I). Patients' age, mean times of intensive care unit stay, diabetic patients, patients who have previous surgery, smokers and patient with pump on situation were related to pressure ulcer development in intensive care unit. The mean score of Braden scale also were statistically higher in patients without ulcer in compared to patients with ulcer (p{\textless}0.05). Conclusion: According to finding of present study, pressure ulcers especially stage 1 and 2 is common among cardiac surgery patients. Health care worker especially nurses should pay more attention to this topic. Further study recommended in this regards.},

abstract = {The characteristic of man in the loop has always brought lots of difficulties for the control of exoskeleton. To solve these, a hybrid control method based on human-machine interaction force (HMIF) is proposed and applied to the control of lower limb exoskeleton in this paper. We innovatively combine ground contact pressure and body contact force together and give full play to their respective advantages. With the virtual modification of human limb impedance properties, the nature of the human body energy saving with exoskeleton is revealed. One of the greatest strengths of this control strategy is that exoskeleton is able to perceive and anticipate the pilot intended motion in real time, thereby decrease the power consumption of pilot and provide most of the strength necessary for human walking. The simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed control strategy. The exoskeleton can follow the pilot's motion trajectory and minimize the body contact force without the exact dynamic model.},

abstract = {Wearable technologies are gaining momentum and widespread diffusion. Thanks to devices such as activity trackers, in form of bracelets, watches, or anklets, the end-users are becoming more and more aware of their daily activity routine, posture, and training and can modify their motor-behavior. Activity trackers are prevalently based on inertial sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes. Loads we bear with us and the interface pressure they put on our body also affect posture. A contact interface pressure sensing wearable would be beneficial to complement inertial activity trackers. What is precluding force sensing resistors (FSR) to be the next best seller wearable? In this paper, we provide elements to answer this question. We build an FSR based on resistive material (Velostat) and printed conductive ink electrodes on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate; we test its response to pressure in the range 0-2.7 kPa. We present a state-of-the-art review, filtered by the need to identify technologies adequate for wearables. We conclude that the repeatability is the major issue yet unsolved.},

abstract = {In exoskeletal robots, the quantification of the user's muscular effort is important to recognize the user's motion intentions and evaluate motor abilities. In this paper, we attempt to estimate users' muscular efforts accurately using joint torque sensor which contains the measurements of dynamic effect of human body such as the inertial, Coriolis, and gravitational torques as well as torque by active muscular effort. It is important to extract the dynamic effects of the user's limb accurately from the measured torque. The user's limb dynamics are formulated and a convenient method of identifying user-specific parameters is suggested for estimating the user's muscular torque in robotic exoskeletons. Experiments were carried out on a wheelchair-integrated lower limb exoskeleton, EXOwheel, which was equipped with torque sensors in the hip and knee joints. The proposed methods were evaluated by 10 healthy participants during body weight-supported gait training. The experimental results show that the torque sensors are to estimate the muscular torque accurately in cases of relaxed and activated muscle conditions.},

abstract = {Hydrogels are commonly used biomaterials for tissue engineering. With their high-water content, good biocompatibility and biodegradability they resemble the natural extracellular environment and have been widely used as scaffolds for 3D cell culture and studies of cell biology. The possible size of such hydrogel constructs with embedded cells is limited by the cellular demand for oxygen and nutrients. For the fabrication of large and complex tissue constructs, vascular structures become necessary within the hydrogels to supply the encapsulated cells. In this review, we discuss the types of hydrogels that are currently used for the fabrication of constructs with embedded vascular networks, the key properties of hydrogels needed for this purpose and current techniques to engineer perfusable vascular structures into these hydrogels. We then discuss directions for future research aimed at engineering of vascularized tissue for implantation.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present an algorithm for planning and control of legged robot locomotion. Given the desired contact sequence, this method generates gaits and dynamic motions for legged robots without resorting to simplified stability criteria. The method uses direct collocation for searching for solutions within the constraint-consistent subspace defined by the robot's contact configuration. For the differential equation constraints of the collocation algorithm, we use the so-called direct dynamics of a constrained multibody system. The dynamics of a legged robot is different for each contact configuration. Our method deals with such a hybrid nature, and it allows for velocity discontinuities when contacts are made. We introduce the projected impact dynamics constraint to enforce consistency during mode switching. We stabilize the plan using an inverse dynamics controller compatible with the optimal feed-forward control of the motion plan. As a whole, this approach reduces the complexity associated with specifying dynamic motions of a floating-base robot under the constant influence of contact forces. We apply this method on a hydraulically-actuated quadruped robot. We show two types of gaits (walking and trotting) as well as diverse jumping motions (forward, sideways, turning) on the real system. The results presented here are one of the few examples of an optimal control problem solved and satisfactorily transferred to a real torquecontrolled legged robot.},

abstract = {Euler angles describe rotations of a rigid body in three-dimensional Cartesian space, as can be obtained by, say, a spherical joint. The rotation carried out by a spherical joint can also be expressed by using three intersecting revolute joints that can be described using the popular Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters. However, the motions of these revolute joints do not necessarily correspond to any set of the Euler angles. This paper attempts to correlate the Euler angles and DH parameters by introducing a concept of DH parameterization of Euler angels. A systematic approach is presented in order to obtain the DH parameters for any Euler angles set. This gives rise to the concept of Euler-angle-joints (EAJs), which provide rotations equivalent to a particular set of Euler angles. Such EAJs can be conveniently used for the modeling of multibody systems having multiple-degrees-of-freedom joints. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2012 by ASME.},

abstract = {Among the various properties exhibited by ionic liquids (ILs)-especially those based on the imidazolium cation-their inherent ionic patterns, very low vapour pressure and pronounced self-organization in the solid, liquid and even in the gas phase are particularly interesting since this allows the use of these fluids as alternative and complementary media to classical organic solvents and water in many applications. Hence, reaction paths that involve charge-separated intermediates or transition states are accelerated-by lowering the activation barrier-in the presence of ILs when compared with those performed in classical organic solvents. It is also possible, for example, to observe, by electrochemical methods, transient species (ionic and radical) that are otherwise undetectible in water or in molecular organic solvents and to investigate the interactions and behaviour of molecular, biological and macromolecular species in solution using physical and chemical methods which require special conditions such as high-vacuum, and which have been traditionally limited to solid state chemistry.},

Objective: To investigate the relieving effect on interface pressure of an alternate sitting protocol involving a sitting posture that reduces ischial support. Design: Repeated measures in 2 protocols on 3 groups of subjects. Setting: Laboratory. Participants: Twenty able-bodied persons, 20 persons with paraplegia, and 20 persons with tetraplegia. Interventions: Two 1-hour protocols were used: alternate and normal plus pushup. In the alternate protocol, sitting posture was alternated every 10 minutes between normal (sitting upright with ischial support) and with partially removed ischial support (WO-BPS) postures; in the normal plus pushup protocol, sitting was in normal posture with pushups (lifting the subject off the seat) performed every 20 minutes. Main Outcome Measure: Interface pressure on seat and backrest. Results: In WO-BPS posture, the concentrated interface pressure observed around the ischia in normal posture was significantly repositioned to the thighs. By cyclically repositioning the interface pressure, the alternate protocol was superior to the normal plus pushup protocol in terms of a significantly lower average interface pressure over the buttocks. Conclusions: A sitting protocol periodically reducing the ischial support helps lower the sitting load on the buttocks, especially the area close to ischial tuberosities. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.},

In the developing countries, most persons with hand disabilities still use manual and passive tools, especially for prosthetic and orthotic. We propose a wearable robot as an orthotic device namely extra robotic thumb and exoskeleton robotic fingers as new type of wearable robot for assisting person whose the thumb can not move anymore and the other four fingers has diminished fingers function. The motion of exoskeleton robotic finger has four DOF which each DOF represents the motion of flexion and extension on the fingers. For extra robotic thumb, it has two DOF to represent the motion of circumduction and flexion/extension on the thumb. The robot employs four linear actuators in exoskeleton robotic fingers and uses two micro servos in extra robotic thumb. The robot is designed based on 3D print technology. To assist person in Activity of Daily Living (ADL), five grip patterns are developed in this research. User can command the robot by using electromyography (EMG) sensor that attached on near healthy elbow. Based on the experimental results, the robot can successfully perform object grasping tasks by using the developed five grip modes.},

abstract = {Teleoperation of multi-robot systems, e.g. dual manipulators, in cooperative manipulation tasks requires haptic feedback of multi-contact interaction forces. Classical haptic devices restrict the workspace of the human operator and provide only one contact point. An alternative solution is to enable the operator to command the robot system via free-hand motions which extends the workspace of the human. In such a setting, a multi-contact haptic feedback may be provided to the human through multiple wearable haptic devices, e.g. fingertip devices that display forces on the human fingertips. In this paper we evaluate the benefit of using wearable haptic fingertip devices to interact with a bimanual robot setup in a pick-and-place manipulation task. We show that haptic feedback through wearable devices improves task performance compared to the base condition of no haptic feedback. Therefore, wearable haptic devices are a promising interface for guidance of multi-robot manipulation systems.},

Experimental and finite element (FE) method is the main approaches to predict the hip fracture of the femur bone. There are several parameters of impact force such as body mass index, the thickness of soft tissue, impact velocity and stiffness of human body that influence the effect of hip fracture during fall. Based on the previous study, force and stiffness result between FE analysis and experimental have shown good correlation. For that reason, the FE method can be applied to predict future result related to the hip fracture research.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In the present study a new shear sensor is introduced with a contact area of 4.05 cm2. A series of validation experiments was performed with ten healthy young subjects. It was demonstrated that with a forward-tilted seat, the sum of the local shear forces between skin and sensormat is equal to the resultant shear force measured with a force plate. This result serves as a validation of the new sensor. The shear values recorded are 4.8 kPa in the longitudinal direction and 8.5 kPa in the transversal direction while sitting in a wheelchair, and 5.6 kPa in the longitudinal direction and 3.1 kPa in the transversal direction on a mattress of a hospital bed, while in sitting position in bed.},

abstract = {In recent years, wearable robots (WRs) for rehabilitation, personal assistance, or human augmentation are gaining increasing interest. To make these devices more energy efficient, radical changes to the mechanical structure of the device are being considered. However, it remains very difficult to predict how people will respond to, and interact with, WRs that differ in terms of mechanical design. Users may adjust their gait pattern in response to the mechanical restrictions or properties of the device. The goal of this pilot study is to show the feasibility of rendering the mechanical properties of different potential WR designs using the robotic gait training device LOPES. This paper describes a new method that selectively cancels the dynamics of LOPES itself and adds the dynamics of the rendered WR using two parallel inverse models. Adaptive frequency oscillators were used to get estimates of the joint position, velocity, and acceleration. Using the inverse models, different WR designs can be evaluated, eliminating the need to build several prototypes. As a proof of principle, we simulated the effect of a very simple WR that consisted of a mass attached to the ankles. Preliminary results show that we are partially able to cancel the dynamics of LOPES. Additionally, the simulation of the mass showed an increase in muscle activity but not in the same level as during the control, where subjects actually carried the mass. In conclusion, the results in this paper suggest that LOPES can be used to render different WRs. In addition, it is very likely that the results can be further optimized when more effort is put in retrieving proper estimations for the velocity and acceleration, which are required for the inverse models.},

However, little is known about the frequency and characteristics of persons who sustain a second hip fracture. Methods: Participants included 481 members of the Framingham Heart Study who sustained an initial hip fracture between April 1952 and December 31, 2003. Participants were followed up until a second hip fracture, death, dropout, or study completion. Age, sex, falls, stroke, dementia, residence, recent weight change, body mass index, and functional status were considered potential predictors of a second hip fracture. Results: During a median of 4.2 years of follow-up, 71 subjects (14.8{\%}) experienced a second hip fracture. Following a first hip fracture, 2.5{\%} of subjects experienced a second hip fracture within 1 year, and 8.2{\%} of subjects (9.7{\%} of women) experienced a second hip fracture within 5 years. One-year mortality following an initial hip fracture was 15.9{\%} compared with 1-year mortality following a second hip fracture of 24.1{\%}. The risk of a second hip fracture increased with age (hazard ratio [HR] per 5-year increase in age, 1.5; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.1-1.8) and with high functional status (HR compared with moderate functional status, 2.7; 95{\%} CI, 1.1-6.9). There was a statistically nonsignificant association between low functional status and the risk of second hip fracture (HR compared with moderate functional status, 3.7; 95{\%} CI, 0.9-14.8). Conclusions: Among survivors of an initial hip fracture, the incidence of a second hip fracture is substantial. Older age and functional status may be important predictors of a second hip fracture. There seems to be adequate time between the first and second hip fractures for interventions that may reduce second hip fractures. {\textcopyright}2007 American Medical Association.

abstract = {CONTEXT The reliability of clinical techniques to quantify thoracic spine rotation range of motion (ROM) has not been evaluated. OBJECTIVE To determine the intratester and intertester reliability of 5 thoracic rotation measurement techniques. DESIGN Descriptive laboratory study. SETTING University research laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS Forty-six healthy volunteers (age = 23.6 ± 4.3 years, height = 171.0 ± 9.6 cm, mass = 71.4 ± 16.7 kg). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) We tested 5 thoracic rotation ROM techniques over 2 days: seated rotation (bar in back and front), half-kneeling rotation (bar in back and front), and lumbar-locked rotation. On day 1, 2 examiners obtained 2 sets of measurements (sessions 1, 2) to determine the within-session intertester reliability and within-day intratester reliability. A single examiner obtained measurements on day 2 (session 3) to determine the intratester reliability between days. Each technique was performed 3 times per side, and averages were used for data analysis. Reliability was determined using intraclass correlation coefficients, standard error of measurement (SEM), and minimal detectable change (MDC). Differences between raters during session 1 were determined using paired t tests. RESULTS Within-session intertester reliability estimates ranged from 0.85 to 0.94. Ranges for the SEM were 1.0° to 2.3° and for the MDC were 2.8° to 6.3°. No differences were seen between examiners during session 1 for seated rotation (bar in front, both sides), half-kneeling rotation (bar in front, left side), or the lumbar locked position (both sides) (all values of P {\textgreater} .05). Within-day intratester reliability estimates ranged from 0.86 to 0.95. Ranges for the SEM were 0.8° to 2.1° and for the MDC were 2.1 ° to 5.9°. Between-days intratester reliability estimates ranged from 0.84 to 0.91. Ranges for the SEM were 1.4° to 2.0° and for the MDC were 3.9° to 5.6°. CONCLUSIONS All techniques had good reliability and low levels of measurement error. The seated rotation, bar in front, and lumbar-locked rotation tests may be used reliably when more than 1 examiner is obtaining measurements.},

abstract = {Limited research has been done on exoskeletons to enable faster movements of the lower extremities. An exoskeleton's mechanism can actually hinder agility by adding weight, inertia and friction to the legs; compensating inertia through control is particularly difficult due to instability issues. The added inertia will reduce the natural frequency of the legs, probably leading to lower step frequency during walking. We present a control method that produces an approximate compensation of an exoskeleton's inertia. The aim is making the natural frequency of the exoskeleton-assisted leg larger than that of the unaided leg. The method uses admittance control to compensate for the weight and friction of the exoskeleton. Inertia compensation is emulated by adding a feedback loop consisting of low-pass filtered acceleration multiplied by a negative gain. This gain simulates negative inertia in the low-frequency range. We tested the controller on a statically supported, single-degree-of-freedom exoskeleton that assists swing movements of the leg. Subjects performed movement sequences, first unassisted and then using the exoskeleton, in the context of a computer-based task resembling a race. With zero inertia compensation, the steady-state frequency of the leg swing was consistently reduced. Adding inertia compensation enabled subjects to recover their normal frequency of swing. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author(s).},

It is based on 210 hips, 180 knees and 192 ankle joints. Arcs of passive motion were measured by techniques suggested by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Significant differences were found between the obtained measurements and previous referenced studies. The differences can be due to the measurement procedure, difficulties in measurement technique, the patient material, and inter-individual variations. There was no statistically significant difference between the motions of the right and left side, and it is therefore suggested that a patient's healthy limb can be used for comparison with the affected side in the presence of disease or a lesion.},

Thirty subjects (15 female, 15 male) participated in this study, their ages ranging from 19 to 45 years with a mean age of 28 years. The normal force, friction force, and coefficient of static friction were determined by measuring three-dimensional forces while slipping the palm of the hand over the surface of a grabrail. A repeated measures ANOVA indicated that gender, age, hand size and trial effect had no significant influence (p{\textgreater}0.05) on these results. The coefficient of friction (p{\textless}0.001) and friction force (p{\textless}0.001) were significantly lower when the hand was soapy than when it was dry or wet. The normal force applied when the hand was soapy was significantly greater (p{\textless}0.001) than when it was dry or wet. No significant difference was found between dry and wet hands.

Despite the increased interest in exoskeleton research in the last decades, not much progress has been made on the successful reduction of user effort. In humans, biarticular elements have been identified as one of the reasons for the energy economy of locomotion. This document gives an extensive literature overview concerning the function of biarticular muscles in human beings. The exact role of these muscles in the efficiency of human locomotion is reduced to three elementary functions: energy transfer towards distal joints, efficient control of output force direction and double joint actuation. This information is used to give an insight in the application of biarticular elements in bio-inspired robotics, i.e. bipedal robots, exoskeletons, robotic manipulators and prostheses. Additionally, an attempt is made to find an answer on the question whether the biarticular property leads to a unique contribution to energy efficiency of locomotion, unachievable by mono-articular alternatives. This knowledge is then further utilised to indicate how biarticular actuation of exoskeletons can contribute to an increased performance in reducing user effort.},

The joints are impedance controlled to allow bidirectional mechanical interaction between the robot and the training subject. Evaluation measurements show that the device allows both a "pa- tient-in-charge" and "robot-in-charge" mode, in which the robot is controlled either to follow or to guide a patient, respectively. Electromyography (EMG) measurements (one subject) on eight important leg muscles, show that free walking in the device strongly resembles free treadmill walking; an indication that the device can offer task-specific gait training. The possibilities and limitations to using the device as gait measurement tool are also shown at the moment position measurements are not accurate enough for inverse-dynamical gait analysis.},

This is especially the case in the measurement of the forces between the plantar surface of the foot and the shoe. Although clinical awareness of the need to simultaneously measure shear and vertical forces under the foot has increased little has been done to provide the technology. This is mainly due to the difficulty in constructing devices capable of carrying out this task in the in-shoe environment. The aim of this paper is to describe the development and characteristics of a miniature triaxial transducer measuring 10 x 10 x 2.7 mm and a weight of only 2 g. This transducer is capable of simultaneously measuring three orthogonal forces under any location of the plantar surface of the foot utilizing a single element piezoelectric copolymer P(VDF-TrFE). Transducer sensitivity, linearity, hysteresis, cross-talk and temperature dependence is presented. As well as in-shoe force measurement, this triaxial transducer could have other biomedical and general engineering applications, e.g., prosthetic interface forces, handgrip forces, sport, robotics, etc.},

abstract = {We propose a novel method to simulate soft tissue deformation for virtual surgery applications. The method considers the mechanical properties of soft tissue, such as its viscoelasticity, nonlinearity and incompressibility; its speed, stability and accuracy also meet the requirements for a surgery simulator. Modifying the traditional equation for mass spring dampers (MSD) introduces nonlinearity and viscoelasticity into the calculation of elastic force. Then, the elastic force is used in the constraint projection step for naturally reducing constraint potential. The node position is enforced by the combined spring force and constraint conservative force through Newton's second law. We conduct a comparison study of conventional MSD and position-based dynamics for our new integrating method. Our approach enables stable, fast and large step simulation by freely controlling visual effects based on nonlinearity, viscoelasticity and incompressibility. We implement a laparoscopic cholecystectomy simulator to demonstrate the practicality of our method, in which liver and gallbladder deformation can be simulated in real time. Our method is an appropriate choice for the development of real-time virtual surgery applications.},

abstract = {In recent years, multiple powered exoskeletons, typically focused on one-DOF (degree of freedom) flexion/extension assistance, have been developed to aid the elderly or patients with hip motion disability. To achieve two-DOF adduction/abduction and flexion/extension assistance, a novel parallel hip-assistive mechanism was proposed, consisting of a waist unit, a leg unit and two parallel driving branches. As the mechanism is connected to the human hip, a human-robot closed chain with three parallel branches is formed. The structure of the parallel assistive mechanism, featuring a bearing-like leg unit prototype to remove the restriction on hip internal/external rotation, was introduced. Subsequently, the mobility assessment of the human-robot closed chain, the position solution of the assistive mechanism and the test approach of branch interference were addressed, with the assumption that the flexible distortions of human bodies are negligible. Finally, the joint motion ranges and branch interference of the mechanism were analyzed, throughout a hip gait cycle. Obtained results indicated that the joint motion ranges are small, with no apparent branch interference, meaning that the proposed parallel mechanism can successfully assist the operation of the hip. Consequently, these results could be used as original design parameters of the assistive mechanism.},

abstract = {The cable-driven exoskeletons have the advantages of low inertia and simple structure, and they are widely applied for human augmentation and rehabilitation. However, they have limited workspace and tension efficiency because of the unidirectional nature of the cables. The limited performance affects the human-robot interaction and leads to potential danger. The workspace and tension efficiency can be optimized by conventional methods, which are adjusting the cable attachment points and increasing the actuators. But the workspace still cannot cover the human joint space of activities of daily living, and the efficiency is also not high. This paper analyzed the specific application for shoulder and elbow joints rehabilitation and proposed a dynamic adaptive structure. This design can increase the workspace and improve tension efficiency greatly. The dynamic compensation control strategy is designed for the optimized system. Besides, in order to reduce the effects of compliant elements (e.g., cables or Bowden cables) between the actuators and output, and to improve the force bandwidth, we designed the distributed active semi-active system composed of the geared DC motor and magnetorheological clutches, which has low output inertia. The related experiments are carried out based on several healthy subjects. The results verified that the exoskeleton with the dynamic adaptive structure has a large workspace covering the activities of daily living joint space, high tension efficiency, and high force bandwidth, which is beneficial for the safety and comfort of human-robot interaction during rehabilitation training.},

This study aimed to examine lower limb joint angles during walking and running by using Inertial Measurement Units. The geometry and kinematic parameters were calculated. Twenty-six healthy adults participated in walking and running experiments. The geometric model of a human leg hydraulic exoskeleton was presented. Joint angle data acquired during experiments were used in the mathematical model. The position and velocity of exoskeleton actuators in each phase of movement were calculated using the MATLAB package (Matlab{\_}R2017b, The MathWorks Company, Novi, MI, USA). The highest velocity of the knee actuator during walking and running was in the swing phase, 0.3 and 0.4 m/s, respectively. For the ankle and hip joints, the highest velocity of actuators occurred during the push-off phase. The results with 26 healthy subjects demonstrated that the system's compliance can be effectively adjusted while guiding the subjects walking in predefined trajectories. The developed mathematical model makes it possible to determine the position of lower limb segments and exoskeleton elements. The proposed model allows for calculating the position of the human leg and actuators' characteristic points.},

increasing every year due to vascular diseases or complications associated with
conditions such as diabetes and trauma. Limb loss has a profound impact on
individual?s physical, mental and vocational abilities, resulting in the degradation of
amputees? quality of life (QOL). Following an amputation, prescription of prosthetic
devices serves as an important step in improving the amputees? QOL.
Restoring functional attributes of human gait is one of the key objectives of
lower limb rehabilitation. A number of studies have been carried out to evaluate the
use of wearable sensors, especially the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), placed at
different body locations to identify gait events/phases. However, a survey of the
literature indicated a lack of research in development of a real-time gait event/phase
detection for lower limb amputees using a single IMU attached to the shank or the
prosthetic pylon.
This research presents the development and evaluation of a low-cost
portable gait monitoring system which detects the temporal gait events, namely
initial contact (IC), foot-flat start (FFS), heel-off (HO) and toe-off TO in real-time
while performing level ground and ramp activities. Foot-switches (FSW) placed
underneath the foot were used as a reference system. Evaluation of the time
difference recorded between the IMU and the FSW confirmed good accuracy and
precision of the proposed system. Overall results showed 100{\%} detection of IC, FFS
and TO and 98.3{\%} detection of HO in both groups (control and amputee) across all
the activities. Finally, to demonstrate its practicality, the proposed system was used
to evaluate and analyse the gait asymmetry for overground and treadmill walking.
Detecting the temporal gait events/phases provide useful information about
clinical parameters such as stance time, swing time, gait cycle duration and gait
asymmetry. The proposed system could be used as a monitoring tool to assess the
progress through rehabilitation, or in the development of control systems for lower
limb amputees and patients with abnormal and pathological gait.},

abstract = {Learning by demonstration methods have gained considerable interest in human-coupled robot control. It aims at modeling the goal motion trajectories through human demonstration. However, in lower exoskeleton control, the physical human-robot interaction is changing from pilot to pilot or even for one pilot in different walking patterns. This characteristic requires that the exoskeletons should have the ability to learn and adapt the motion trajectories as well as controllers online. This paper presents a novel Hierarchical Interactive Learning (HIL) strategy which reduces the complexity of the exoskeleton sensory system and is able to handle varying interaction dynamics. The proposed HIL strategy is composed of two learning hierarchies, namely, high-level motion learning and low-level controller learning. The Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) combined with Locally Weighted Regression (LWR) are employed to model and learn the motion trajectories, while reinforcement learning (RL) is used to learn the model-based controller. We demonstrate the efficiency of proposed HIL strategy on a single degree-of-freedom (DOF) platform as well as a HUman-powered Augmentation Lower EXoskeleton (HUALEX) system. Experimental results indicate that the proposed HIL strategy is able to handle the varying interaction dynamics with less interaction force between the pilot and the exoskeleton when compared to traditional model-based control algorithms.},

Here, we introduce OpenSim Moco, a software toolkit for optimizing the motion and control of musculoskeletal models built in the OpenSim modeling and simulation package. OpenSim Moco uses the direct collocation method, which is often faster and can handle more diverse problems than other methods for musculoskeletal simulation. Moco frees researchers from implementing direct collocation themselves—which typically requires extensive technical expertise—and allows them to focus on their scientific questions. The software can handle a wide range of problems that interest biomechanists, including motion tracking, motion prediction, parameter optimization, model fitting, electromyography-driven simulation, and device design. Moco is the first musculoskeletal direct collocation tool to handle kinematic constraints, which enable modeling of kinematic loops (e.g., cycling models) and complex anatomy (e.g., patellar motion). To show the abilities of Moco, we first solved for muscle activity that produced an observed walking motion while minimizing squared muscle excitations and knee joint loading. Next, we predicted how muscle weakness may cause deviations from a normal walking motion. Lastly, we predicted a squat-to-stand motion and optimized the stiffness of an assistive device placed at the knee. We designed Moco to be easy to use, customizable, and extensible, thereby accelerating the use of simulations to understand the movement of humans and other animals.},

Because actuators are sewn into the garment, no metal frame is needed, making the muscle suit very light and cheap.

With the muscle suit, the patient can willfully control his or her movement. The muscle suit is very helpful for both muscular and emotional support. In this paper, we propose an armor-type muscle suit in order to overcome issues of a prototype system and then show how abduction motion, which we believe is the most difficult motion for the upper body, is realized.

abstract = {Many human augmentation devices have been developed in the past few decades, but lots of them neglected the importance of well-timed assistance, which commonly leads to problems like lowered performance or interference with user's movement. In this research the authors focused in depth on the timing issue of powered assistance. As a pilot study for the proof of concept, the authors hypothesized that different timing of assistance may greatly affect the efficiency of movement for power-assisting devices, and verified the hypothesis through human experiment on sit-to-stand (STS) movement. By measuring the electromyogram (EMG) of lower limb muscles, the authors firstly confirmed the effectiveness of assistance, then compared the effect of assistance timing with other frequently investigated determinants of STS movement, and evaluated the efficiency of movement under different timing conditions. The results demonstrated the importance of timing in powered assistance, and showed that, rather than the common practice of providing assistance after the onset of movement, which is adopted by most traditional proportional-EMG-controlled human augmentation devices, it may improve the efficiency of movement for at least half of the subjects simply by adopting an earlier (before or at the same time of movement onset) but optimal timing for assistance. As a preparation for future works, the authors also quantitatively analyzed various early timing conditions, and the result indicated that if the authors could realize appropriate movement prediction mechanism, the performance of assistance may be improved further. Considering the generality of timing issue in many related works, these results could lead to a new direction of research on performance improvement of human augmentation devices.},

abstract = {In this paper, a wearable and force-controllable hand exoskeleton system is proposed. In order to apply force feedback to the fingertip while allowing natural finger motions, the exoskeleton linkage structure with three degrees of freedom (DOFs) was designed, which was inspired by the muscular skeletal structure of the finger. Kinematic performance of the proposed linkage structure was verified by comparing with functional range of motion (ROM) which is required for activities in daily living. As an actuating system, a series elastic actuator (SEA) mechanism, which consisted of a small linear motor, a manually designed motor driver, a spring and potentiometers, was applied. Friction of the motor was identified and compensated to obtain a linearized model of the actuating system. Using a linear quadratic (LQ) tuned proportional-derivative (PD) controller and a disturbance observer (DOB), the proposed actuator module could generate the desired force accurately even with arbitrary finger movement. The performance of force transmission through linkage structure was verified by simulation and experiments. The proposed exoskeleton structure, actuator modules and control algorithms were integrated as a wearable and force-controllable hand exoskeleton system that could deliver force to the fingertips for flexion/extension motions.},

abstract = {Objective. The goal of this study was to compare the muscle activation patterns in various major leg muscles during treadmill ambulation with those exhibited during robotic-assisted walking. Background. Robotic devices are now being integrated into neurorehabilitation programs with promising results. The influence of these devices on altering naturally occurring muscle activation patterns utilized during walking have not been quantified. Methods. Muscle activity measured during 60 s of walking was broken up into individual stride cycles, averaged, and normalized. The stride cycle was then broken up into seven distinct phases and the integrated muscle activity during each phase was compared between treadmill and robotic-assisted walking using a multi-factor ANOVA. Results. Significant differences in the spatial and temporal muscle activation patterns were observed across various portions of the gait cycle between treadmill and robotic-assisted walking. Activity in the quadriceps and hamstrings was significantly higher during the swing phase of Lokomat walking than treadmill walking, while activity in the ankle flexor and extensor muscles was reduced throughout most of the gait cycle in the Lokomat. Conclusions. Walking within a robotic orthosis that limits the degrees of freedom of leg and pelvis movement leads to changes in naturally occurring muscle activation patterns. An understanding of how robotic-assisted walking alters muscle activation patterns is necessary clinically in order to establish baseline patterns against which subject's with neurological disorders can be compared. Furthermore, this information will guide further developments in robotic devices targeting gait training. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Forces transferred to the upper body during crutch use can lead to both short-term and long-term injuries, including joint pain, crutch palsy, and over-use injuries. While this force transmission has been studied in controlled laboratory settings, it is unclear how these forces are affected by irregular terrains commonly encountered during community ambulation. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of walking speed and uneven terrain on the load magnitude, distribution, and rate of loading at the human-crutch contact surfaces. Our results show that the rates of loading were significantly increased with higher walking speeds and while negotiating certain irregular terrains, despite there being no apparent effect on the peak force transmission, suggesting load rate may be a more appropriate metric for assessing terrain effects on crutch gait. Furthermore, irrespective of the type of terrain and walking condition, the largest compressive forces were found to reside in the carpal-tunnel region of the hand, and may therefore be a primary contributor to carpal-tunnel injury.},

[Subjects and Methods] Twenty-six healthy adults assumed two postures while seated in a wheelchair: a basic sitting posture, and sacral sitting with the pelvis tilted posteriorly and the ischium slid forward by 5 cm relative to its position in the basic sitting posture. The inclination angle of the sagittal pelvic line, contact pressures and contact areas on the buttocks and back, and the shear force generated by sliding the ischial region forward were measured. [Results] Posterior pelvic tilt was significantly greater during sacral sitting. Maximum contact pressures on the buttocks and ischial region were significantly lower during sacral than during basic sitting. However, maximum contact pressure on the back, the contact areas of the buttocks and back, and the shear force generated by sliding the ischial region forward were significantly greater during sacral sitting. [Conclusion] Sacral sitting in a wheelchair increases the maximum contact pressure on the back, contact areas of the buttocks and back, and the shear force generated by sliding the ischial region forward.},

It is shown by experimental results that the attachment pressure has a dominant effect on perceived comfort, mental load, physical demand and effort experienced by subjects and is optimal within a range of 10 – 30 mmHg. Furthermore, it is shown that the inclusion of passive compensatory joints inside an exoskeleton's structure can reduce mental demand during a tracking task. When the outcome of this paper is interpreted combination with a set of objective performance results that were presented earlier [1], the subjective performance metrics underline the fact that passive compensatory joints paired with an attachment pressure of 20 mmHg increase ergonomics and provide optimal conditions for task performance and comfort.},

abstract = {Accurate predictive simulations of human gait rely on optimisation criteria to solve the system's redundancy. Defining such criteria is challenging, as the objectives driving the optimization of human gait are unclear. This study evaluated how minimising various physiologically-based criteria (i.e., cost of transport, muscle activity, head stability, foot–ground impact, and knee ligament use) affects the predicted gait, and developed and evaluated a combined, weighted cost function tuned to predict healthy gait. A generic planar musculoskeletal model with 18 Hill-type muscles was actuated using a reflex-based, parameterized controller. First, the criteria were applied into the base simulation framework separately. The gait pattern predicted by minimising each criterion was compared to experimental data of healthy gait using coefficients of determination (R2) and root mean square errors (RMSE) averaged over all biomechanical variables. Second, the optimal weighted combined cost function was created through stepwise addition of the criteria. Third, performance of the resulting combined cost function was evaluated by comparing the predicted gait to a simulation that was optimised solely to track experimental data. Optimising for each of the criteria separately showed their individual contribution to distinct aspects of gait (overall R2: 0.37–0.56; RMSE: 3.47–4.63 SD). An optimally weighted combined cost function provided improved overall agreement with experimental data (overall R2: 0.72; RMSE: 2.10 SD), and its performance was close to what is maximally achievable for the underlying simulation framework. This study showed how various optimisation criteria contribute to synthesising gait and that careful weighting of them is essential in predicting healthy gait.},

It is capable of simultaneously measuring normal (pressure) and tangential (shear) stresses at the interface between a fingertip and external objects. This could be potentially exploitable for applications in the fields of upper limb prosthetics, robotics, hand rehabilitation and so on. The system was calibrated and its performance was tested using a test machine. To do so, specific test protocols reproducing typical stress profiles in fingertip contact interactions were designed. Results show the system's capability to measure the applied pressure and stresses, respectively, with high linearity between the measured and applied stresses. Subsequently, as a case study, a 'press-drag-lift' based fingertip contact test was conducted by using a finger of a healthy subject. This was to provide an initial evaluation for real-life applications. The case study results indicate that both interface pressure and shear were indeed measured simultaneously, which aligns well with the designed finger test protocols. The potential applications for the sensor system and corresponding future works are also discussed.},

abstract = {Background: Powered exoskeletons are designed to safely facilitate ambulation in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). We conducted the first meta-analysis of the available published research on the clinical effectiveness and safety of powered exoskeletons in SCI patients. Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for studies of powered exoskeleton-assisted walking in patients with SCI. Main outcomes were analyzed using fixed and random effects meta-analysis models. Results: A total of 14 studies (eight ReWalk™, three Ekso™, two Indego{\textregistered}, and one unspecified exoskeleton) representing 111 patients were included in the analysis. Training programs were typically conducted three times per week, 60-120 minutes per session, for 1-24 weeks. Ten studies utilized flat indoor surfaces for training and four studies incorporated complex training, including walking outdoors, navigating obstacles, climbing and descending stairs, and performing activities of daily living. Following the exoskeleton training program, 76{\%} of patients were able to ambulate with no physical assistance. The weighted mean distance for the 6-minute walk test was 98 m. The physiologic demand of powered exoskeleton-assisted walking was 3.3 metabolic equivalents and rating of perceived exertion was 10 on the Borg 6-20 scale, comparable to self-reported exertion of an able-bodied person walking at 3 miles per hour. Improvements in spasticity and bowel movement regularity were reported in 38{\%} and 61{\%} of patients, re spectively. No serious adverse events occurred. The incidence of fall at any time during training was 4.4{\%}, all occurring while tethered using a first-generation exoskeleton and none resulting in injury. The incidence of bone fracture during training was 3.4{\%}. These risks have since been mitigated with newer generation exoskeletons and refinements to patient eligibility criteria. Conclusion: Powered exoskeletons allow patients with SCI to safely ambulate in real-world settings at a physical activity intensity conducive to prolonged use and known to yield health benefits.},

abstract = {Background: The development of interactive rehabilitation technologies which rely on wearable-sensing for upper body rehabilitation is attracting increasing research interest. This paper reviews related research with the aim: 1) To inventory and classify interactive wearable systems for movement and posture monitoring during upper body rehabilitation, regarding the sensing technology, system measurements and feedback conditions; 2) To gauge the wearability of the wearable systems; 3) To inventory the availability of clinical evidence supporting the effectiveness of related technologies. Method: A systematic literature search was conducted in the following search engines: PubMed, ACM, Scopus and IEEE (January 2010-April 2016). Results: Forty-five papers were included and discussed in a new cuboid taxonomy which consists of 3 dimensions: sensing technology, feedback modalities and system measurements. Wearable sensor systems were developed for persons in: 1) Neuro-rehabilitation: stroke (n = 21), spinal cord injury (n = 1), cerebral palsy (n = 2), Alzheimer (n = 1); 2) Musculoskeletal impairment: ligament rehabilitation (n = 1), arthritis (n = 1), frozen shoulder (n = 1), bones trauma (n = 1); 3) Others: chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (n = 1), chronic pain rehabilitation (n = 1) and other general rehabilitation (n = 14). Accelerometers and inertial measurement units (IMU) are the most frequently used technologies (84{\%} of the papers). They are mostly used in multiple sensor configurations to measure upper limb kinematics and/or trunk posture. Sensors are placed mostly on the trunk, upper arm, the forearm, the wrist, and the finger. Typically sensors are attachable rather than embedded in wearable devices and garments; although studies that embed and integrate sensors are increasing in the last 4 years. 16 studies applied knowledge of result (KR) feedback, 14 studies applied knowledge of performance (KP) feedback and 15 studies applied both in various modalities. 16 studies have conducted their evaluation with patients and reported usability tests, while only three of them conducted clinical trials including one randomized clinical trial. Conclusions: This review has shown that wearable systems are used mostly for the monitoring and provision of feedback on posture and upper extremity movements in stroke rehabilitation. The results indicated that accelerometers and IMUs are the most frequently used sensors, in most cases attached to the body through ad hoc contraptions for the purpose of improving range of motion and movement performance during upper body rehabilitation. Systems featuring sensors embedded in wearable appliances or garments are only beginning to emerge. Similarly, clinical evaluations are scarce and are further needed to provide evidence on effectiveness and pave the path towards implementation in clinical settings.},

Biomechanical modeling and computer simulation complement observations and inform experimental design. Biological models are complex and specialized software is required for building, validating, and studying them. Furthermore, common access is needed so that investigators can contribute models to a broader community and leverage past work. We are developing OpenSim, a freely available musculoskeletal modeling and simulation application and libraries specialized for these purposes, by providing: musculoskeletal modeling elements, such as biomechanical joints, muscle actuators, ligament forces, compliant contact, and controllers; and tools for fitting generic models to subject-specific data, performing inverse kinematics and forward dynamic simulations. OpenSim performs an array of physics-based analyses to delve into the behavior of musculoskeletal models by employing Simbody, an efficient and accurate multibody system dynamics code. Models are publicly available and are often reused for multiple investigations because they provide a rich set of behaviors that enables different lines of inquiry. This report will discuss one model developed to study walking and applied to gain deeper insights into muscle function in pathological gait and during running. We then illustrate how simulations can test fundamental hypotheses and focus the aims of in vivo experiments, with a postural stability platform and human model that provide a research environment for performing human posture experiments in silico. We encourage wide adoption of OpenSim for community exchange of biomechanical models and methods and welcome new contributors. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {With 12-month prevalence rates of more than 70{\%}, back pain is currently one of the major health problems for German adults and entails major economic consequences. The aim of this study was to estimate back pain-related costs from a societal perspective and to determine the impact of sociodemographic variables on costs. Based on back pain-related survey data of a large German adult sample (9267 respondents, response rate 60{\%}), costs were assessed using a prevalence-based bottom-up approach. Direct costs caused by utilisation of healthcare services, as well as indirect costs due to back pain-related production losses were considered. All prices are expressed in 2005 Euros. Average total back pain costs per patient were estimated to be €1322 (95{\%} CI [1173-1487]) per year. These costs are split between direct (46{\%}) and indirect (54{\%}) costs. Bivariate analysis showed considerable differences in total costs between the Von Korff back pain grades (GCPS Group I: Mean 414.4, 95{\%} CI [333.2-506.3]; II: 783.6 [574.5-1044.4]; III: 3017.2 [2392.9-3708.6]; IV: 7115.7 [5418.5-9006.5]). Male gender, increasing age, single status, low education, unemployment, and increasing back pain grade had a significant positive impact on the cost magnitude in multivariate analysis. Despite several limitations, this study provides important information concerning the relevance of back pain as a health problem and its socioeconomic consequences. The information may be of value for decision-making and allocation of research fund resources. {\textcopyright} 2008 European Federation of Chapters of the International Association for the Study of Pain.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams  {\&}  Wilkins. Objective: Deep tissue injury (DTI) is caused by prolonged mechanical loading that disrupts blood flow and metabolic clearance. A patient simulator that mimics the biomechanical aspects of DTI initiation, stress and strain in deep muscle tissue, would be potentially useful as a training tool for pressure-relief techniques and testing platform for pressure-mitigating products. As a step toward this goal, this study evaluates the ability of silicone materials to mimic the distribution of stress in muscle tissue under concentrated loading. Methods: To quantify the mechanical properties of candidate silicone materials, unconfined compression experiments were conducted on 3 silicone formulations (Ecoflex 0030, Ecoflex 0010, and Dragon Skin; Smooth-On, Inc, Easton, Pennsylvania). Results were fit to an Ogden hyperelastic material model, and the resulting shear moduli (G) were compared with published values for biological tissues. Indentation tests were then conducted on Ecoflex 0030 and porcine muscle to investigate silicone's ability to mimic the nonuniform stress distribution muscle demonstrates under concentrated loading. Finite element models were created to quantify stresses throughout tissue depth. Finally, a preliminary patient simulator prototype was constructed, and both deep and superficial "tissue" pressures were recorded to examine stress dis tribution. Results: Indentation tests showed similar stress distribution trends in muscle and Ecoflex 0030, but stress magnitudes were higher in Ecoflex 0030 than in porcine muscle. All 3 silicone formulations demonstrated shear moduli within the range of published values for biological tissue. For the experimental conditions reported in this work, Ecoflex 0030 exhibited greater stiffness than porcine muscle. Conclusion: Indentation tests and the prototype patient simulator trial demonstrated similar trends with high pressures closest to the bony prominence with decreasing magnitude toward the interfacial surface. Qualitatively, silicone mimicked the phenomenon observed in muscle of nonuniform stress under concentrated loading. Although shear moduli were within biological ranges, stress and stiffness values exceeded those of porcine muscle. This research represents a first step toward development of a preclinical model simulating the biomechanical conditions of stress and strain in deep muscle, since local biomechanical factors are acknowledged to play a role in DTI initiation.

abstract = {This report presents a novel orientation filter applicable to IMUs consisting of tri-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers, and MARG sensor arrays that also include tri-axis magnetometers. The MARG implementation incorporates magnetic distortion and gyroscope bias drift compensation. The filter uses a quaternion representation, allowing accelerometer and magnetometer data to be used in an analytically derived and optimised gradient-descent algorithm to compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative. The benefits of the filter include: (1) computationally inexpensive; requiring 109 (IMU) or 277 (MARG) scalar arithmetic operations each filter update, (2) effective at low sampling rates; e.g. 10 Hz, and (3) contains 1 (IMU) or 2 (MARG) adjustable parameters defined by observable system characteristics. Performance was evaluated empirically using a commercially available orientation sensor and reference measurements of orientation obtained using an optical measurement system. A simple calibration method is presented for the use of the optical measurement equipment in this application. Performance was also benchmarked against the propriety Kalman-based algorithm of orientation sensor. Results indicate the filter achieves levels of accuracy exceeding that of the Kalman-based algorithm; {\textless} 0.6◦ static RMS error, {\textless} 0.8◦ dynamic RMS error. The implications of the low computational load and ability to operate at low sampling rates open new opportunities for the use of IMU and MARG sensor arrays in real-time applications of limited power or processing resources or applications that demand extremely high sampling rates},

@article{Freund1986,
abstract = {The time control of self-initiated voluntary limb movements is more difficult to assess than that in the oculomotor system, where saccadic and pursuit eye movements are regarded as the products of two independent control systems. The different velocities of the two types of eye movement depend on vestibular and visual inputs as well as on movement amplitude. In contrast to these different types of eye movements, velocity control in the skeletal motor system is continuous, such that limb muscles can produce movements resembling the pursuit or saccadic type of eye movements. In spite of this continuum of possible performances, it is a widely held view that in the skeletal motor system ballistic and ramp movements represents different categories. A difficulty in a comparative analysis of time control in the two systems lies in their different accessibility to examination. Eye movements can be examined in response to visual and vestibular inputs and described in terms of input-output relationships. In reflex studies, this is also possible for limb movements. However, the wide range of input variables and of possible performances of limb movements makes it difficult to explore the control strategies relevant for their performance. A closer understanding of the mechanisms underlying the matching of certain temporal demands for perception and motor control is an intriguing problem for future research. {\textcopyright} 1986, Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

abstract = {Multibody software designed for mechanical engineering has been successfully employed in biomedical research for many years. For real time operation some biomedical researchers have also adapted game physics engines. However, these tools were built for other purposes and do not fully address the needs of biomedical researchers using them to analyze the dynamics of biological structures and make clinically meaningful recommendations. We are addressing this problem through the development of an open source, extensible, high performance toolkit including a multibody mechanics library aimed at the needs of biomedical researchers. The resulting code, Simbody, supports research in a variety of fields including neuromuscular, prosthetic, and biomolecular simulation, and related research such as biologically-inspired design and control of humanoid robots and avatars. Simbody is the dynamics engine behind OpenSim, a widely used biomechanics simulation application. This article reviews issues that arise uniquely in biomedical research, and reports on the architecture, theory, and computational methods Simbody uses to address them. By addressing these needs explicitly Simbody provides a better match to the needs of researchers than can be obtained by adaptation of mechanical engineering or gaming codes. Simbody is a community resource, free for any purpose. We encourage wide adoption and invite contributions to the code base at https://simtk.org/home/simbody. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

The sagittal hip, knee, and ankle degrees-of-freedom are actuated using a set of eight Hill-type musculotendon models in each leg, with biologically-motivated control laws. The parameters of these control laws are set by an optimization procedure that satisfies a number of locomotion task terms while minimizing a biological model of metabolic energy expenditure. We show that the use of biologically-based actuators and objectives measurably increases the realism of gaits generated by locomotion controllers that operate without the use of motion capture data, and that metabolic energy expenditure provides a simple and unifying measurement of effort that can be used for both walking and running control optimization. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM 0730-0301/2012/08-ART25.},

abstract = {EMG-to-force estimation for voluntary muscle contraction has many applications in human-machine interaction, motion analysis, and rehabilitation robotics for prosthetic limbs or exoskeletons. EMG-based model can account for a subject's individual activation patterns to estimate muscle force. For the estimation, so-called Hill-type model has been used in most of the cases. It already has shown its promising performance, but it is still known as a phenomenological model considering only macroscopic physiology. We have already developed the physiological based muscle model for the use of functional electrical stimulation (FES) which can render the myoelectrical property also in microscopic scale. In this paper we discuss EMG-to-force estimation based on this full physiological based muscle model in voluntary contraction. In addition to Hill macroscopic structure, a microscopic physiology originally designed by Huxley is integrated. It has significant meaning to realize the same kind of EMG-to-force estimation with a physiological based model not with a phenomenological model, because it brings the understanding of the internal biophysical dynamics and new insights about neuromuscular activations. Using same EMG data of isometric muscle contraction, the force estimation results are shown by classical approach and new physiological based approach. Its interpretation is also discussed.},

In the generation of gait patterns for the step, toe trajectories are generated according to the height of the step to avoid collision of the swinging leg with the step. The hip trajectory is generated by an optimization technique that minimizes the sum of the joint angular jerk of the robot subject to constraints on the hip position and the velocity at toe liftoff. Each joint angle trajectory is calculated from the generated trajectories by means of inverse kinematic equations. We investigated the feasibility of the proposed sensor and control systems for two steps with different heights.},

However, the majority of LEPEs walk slowly and users can become fatigued from overuse of forearm crutches, suggesting LEPE design can be enhanced. Virtual prototyping is a cost-effective way of improving design; therefore, this research developed and validated two models that simulate walking with the Bionik Laboratories' ARKE exoskeleton attached to a human musculoskeletal model. The first model was driven by kinematic data from 30 able-bodied participants walking at realistic slow walking speeds (0.2-0.8 m/s) and accurately predicted ground reaction forces (GRF) for all speeds. The second model added upper limb crutches and was driven by 3-D-marker data from five SCI participants walking with ARKE. Vertical GRF had the strongest correlations ({\textgreater}0.90) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mediolateral center of pressure trajectory had the weakest ({\textless}0.35), for both models. Strong correlations and small RMSE between predicted and measured GRFs support the use of these models for optimizing LEPE joint mechanics and improving LEPE design.},

The motivation behind the proposed design is to produce a relatively inexpensive skin having the capability to provide the spatial location of collisions and also to add compliance to the robot's external cover. The resulting device is a thin flexible sensor sheet made of polyimide films with electrically conductive ink and a pressure sensitive conductive rubber sheet. The problem of internal wire routing is circumvented by the use of conductive ink and a circuit is proposed to minimize the number of output wires. To provide collision absorption and mechanical robustness, the sensor is embedded in different layers of polyurethane using shape deposition manufacturing (SDM). The paper presents the design and the fabrication process of the skin but also some experimental results on the determination of the mechanical properties of the resulting sensor as well as its potential for increasing human safety during human robot interaction.},

abstract = {Although the socket is critical in a prosthetic system for a person with limb amputation, the methods of its design are largely artisanal. A roadblock for a repeatable and quantitative socket design process is the lack of predictive and patient specific biomechanical models of the residuum. This study presents the evaluation of such a model using a combined experimental-numerical approach. The model geometry and tissue boundaries are derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The soft tissue non-linear elastic and viscoelastic mechanical behavior was evaluated using inverse finite element analysis (FEA) of in-vivo indentation experiments. A custom designed robotic in-vivo indentation system was used to provide a rich experimental data set of force versus time at 18 sites across a limb. During FEA, the tissues were represented by two layers, namely the skin-adipose layer and an underlying muscle-soft tissue complex. The non-linear elastic behavior was modeled using 2nd order Ogden hyperelastic formulations, and viscoelasticity was modeled using the quasi-linear theory of viscoelasticity. To determine the material parameters for each tissue, an inverse FEA based optimization routine was used that minimizes the combined mean of the squared force differences between the numerical and experimental force-time curves for indentations at 4 distinct anatomical regions on the residuum. The optimization provided the following material parameters for the skin-adipose layer: [. c=5.22kPa m=4.79 $\gamma$=3.57MPa $\tau$=0.32s] and for the muscle-soft tissue complex [. c=5.20kPam=4.78$\gamma$=3.47MPa$\tau$=0.34s]. These parameters were evaluated to predict the force-time curves for the remaining 14 anatomical locations. The mean percentage error (mean absolute error/ maximum experimental force) for these predictions was 7±3{\%}. The mean percentage error at the 4 sites used for the optimization was 4{\%}.},

Decreased body weight was associated with higher bone loss in all measured bone sites. High calcium intake and better preservation of physical fitness were associated with a smaller decrease in femoral neck BMC.},

abstract = {Simultaneously considering the physical interaction between the user and the robot within safety and performance constraints in rehabilitation and human walking situations, this paper proposes a new backdrivable torsion spring actuator (BTSA) with hybrid control that switches between direct electromyography (EMG) biofeedback control and zero impedance control, to provide a novel rehabilitation training and walking assistance mechanism for humans. The proposed backdrivable 1-DOF serial elastic actuator is designed to achieve intrinsic safety, compliance properties, and control performance. The proposed mechanical system can provide desirable backdrivable property and softer stiffness than that of traditional robots. In additional, the proposed hybrid control not only considers the assistive function, when human assistance is required, but also the compliance property, when assistance is not needed. Compared to state-of-the-art assistive methods, the BTSA with the proposed hybrid control system is unique in that it can simultaneously achieve assistance control through EMG biofeedback and compliance control through zero impedance control. A simple human-robot interaction model is built to investigate performance and explain the whole control concept. Further, a knee exoskeleton is built and three kinds of controls are used on a human subject to demonstrate the difference between them. Both simulation and experimental results show that the proposed BTSA mechanism with hybrid control offers the desired properties.},

abstract = {Skeletal muscle is the most abundant tissue in the body and serves various physiological functions including the generation of movement and support. Whole body motor function requires adequate quantity, geometry, and distribution of muscle. This raises the question: how do muscles scale with subject size in order to achieve similar function across humans$\alpha$ While much of the current knowledge of human muscle architecture is based on cadaver dissection, modern medical imaging avoids limitations of old age, poor health, and limited subject pool, allowing for muscle architecture data to be obtained in vivo from healthy subjects ranging in size. The purpose of this study was to use novel fast-acquisition MRI to quantify volumes and lengths of 35 major lower limb muscles in 24 young, healthy subjects and to determine if muscle size correlates with bone geometry and subject parameters of mass and height. It was found that total lower limb muscle volume scales with mass (R2=0.85) and with the height-mass product (R2=0.92). Furthermore, individual muscle volumes scale with total muscle volume (median R2=0.66), with the height-mass product (median R2=0.61), and with mass (median R2=0.52). Muscle volume scales with bone volume (R2=0.75), and muscle length relative to bone length is conserved (median s.d = 2.1{\%} of limb length). These relationships allow for an arbitrary subject's individual muscle volumes to be estimated from mass or mass and height while muscle lengths may be estimated from limb length. The dataset presented here can further be used as a normative standard to compare populations with musculoskeletal pathologies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The thyroid, submandibular, and parotid glands, masseter and gastrocnemius muscles, supraspinatus and Achilles tendons, renal cortex and pelvis, pancreas, and spleen of 127 healthy volunteers (89 women, 38 men; mean age, 37.72 ± 9.11 years; range, 17-63 years) were evaluated with shear-wave ultrasound elastography. RESULTS. The mean elasticity values were determined to be 10.97 ± 3.1 kPa for the thyroid, 10.92 ± 3.1 kPa for the submandibular glands, 10.38 ± 3.5 kPa for the parotid glands, 10.4 ± 3.7 kPa for the masseter muscle, 11.1 ± 4.1 kPa for the gastrocnemius muscle, 31.2 ± 13 kPa for the supraspinatus muscle, 51.5 ± 25.1 kPa for the Achilles tendons, 5.0 ± 2.9 kPa for the renal cortex, 23.6 ± 5.4 kPa for the renal pelvis, 4.8 ± 3 kPa for the pancreas, and 2.9 ± 1.8 kPa for the spleen.

abstract = {The exoskeleton is an external structural mechanism with joints and links corresponding to those of the human body. Worn by the human, the exoskeleton transmits torques from proximally located actuators through rigid exoskeletal links to the human joints. This paper presents the development of an anthropometric seven degree-of-freedom powered exoskeleton for the upper limb. The design was based on a database defining the kinematics and dynamics of the upper limb during daily living activities, as well as joint physiological and upper limb anatomical considerations, workspace analyses, and joint ranges of motion. Proximal placement of motors and distal placement of pulley reductions were incorporated into the design of a cable-driven wearable robotic arm. This design led to low inertias, high-stiffness links, and back-drivable transmissions with zero backlash. Potential applications of the exoskeleton as a wearable robot include use as: (1) a therapeutic and diagnostics device for physiotherapy, (2) an assistive (orthotic) device for human power amplifications, (3) a haptic device in virtual reality simulation, and (4) a master device for teleoperation},

abstract = {Wearable robotic devices have been shown to substantially reduce the energy expenditure of human walking. However, response variance between participants for fixed control strategies can be high, leading to the hypothesis that individualized controllers could further improve walking economy. Recent studies on human-in-the-loop (HIL) control optimization have elucidated several practical challenges, such as long experimental protocols and low signal-to-noise ratios. Here, we used Bayesian optimization—an algorithm well suited to optimizing noisy performance signals with very limited data—to identify the peak and offset timing of hip extension assistance that minimizes the energy expenditure of walking with a textile-based wearable device. Optimal peak and offset timing were found over an average of 21.4 ± 1.0 min and reduced metabolic cost by 17.4 ± 3.2{\%} compared with walking without the device (mean ± SEM), which represents an improvement of more than 60{\%} on metabolic reduction compared with state-of-the-art devices that only assist hip extension. In addition, our results provide evidence for participant-specific metabolic distributions with respect to peak and offset timing and metabolic landscapes, lending support to the hypothesis that individualized control strategies can offer substantial benefits over fixed control strategies. These results also suggest that this method could have practical impact on improving the performance of wearable robotic devices.},

abstract = {A shared design goal for most robotic lower limb exoskeletons is to reduce the metabolic cost of locomotion for the user. Despite this, only a limited amount of devices was able to actually reduce user metabolic consumption. Preservation of the natural motion kinematics was defined as an important requirement for a device to be metabolically beneficial. This requires the inclusion of all human degrees of freedom (DOF) in a design, as well as perfect alignment of the rotation axes. As perfect alignment is impossible, compensation for misalignment effects should be provided. A misalignment compensation mechanism for a 3-DOF system is presented in this paper. It is validated by the implementation in a bilateral hip exoskeleton, resulting in a compact and lightweight device that can be donned fast and autonomously, with a minimum of required adaptations. Extensive testing of the prototype has shown that hip range of motion of the user is maintained while wearing the device and this for all three hip DOFs. This allowed the users to maintain their natural motion patterns when they are walking with the novel hip exoskeleton.},

abstract = {The integration of an Inertial Navigation System (INS) and the Global Positioning System (GPS) is common in mobile mapping and navigation applications to seamlessly determine the position, velocity, and orientation of the mobile platform. In most INS/GPS integrated architectures, the GPS is considered to be an accurate reference with which to correct for the systematic errors of the inertial sensors, which are composed of biases, scale factors and drift. However, the GPS receiver may produce abnormal pseudo-range errors mainly caused by ionospheric delay, tropospheric delay and the multipath effect. These errors degrade the overall position accuracy of an integrated system that uses conventional INS/GPS integration strategies such as loosely coupled (LC) and tightly coupled (TC) schemes. Conventional tightly coupled INS/GPS integration schemes apply the Klobuchar model and the Hopfield model to reduce pseudo-range delays caused by ionospheric delay and tropospheric delay, respectively, but do not address the multipath problem. However, the multipath effect (from reflected GPS signals) affects the position error far more significantly in a consumer-grade GPS receiver than in an expensive, geodetic-grade GPS receiver. To avoid this problem, a new integrated INS/GPS architecture is proposed. The proposed method is described and applied in a real-time integrated system with two integration strategies, namely, loosely coupled and tightly coupled schemes, respectively. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, field tests with various scenarios are conducted and the results are compared with a reliable reference system. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {Degenerative wear to the glenoid from repetitive loading can reduce effective concavity depth and lead to future instability. Workspace design should consider glenohumeral stability to prevent initial wear. While glenohumeral stability has been previously explored for activities of daily living including push-pull tasks, whether stability is spatially dependent is unexplored. We simulated bimanual and unimanual push-pull tasks to four horizontal targets (planes of elevation: 0 deg, 45 deg, 90 deg, and 135 deg) at 90 deg thoracohumeral elevation and three elevation targets (thoracohumeral elevations: 20 deg, 90 deg, 170 deg) at 90 deg plane of elevation. The 45 deg horizontal target was most stable regardless of exertion type and would be the ideal target placement when considering stability. This target is likely more stable because the applied load acts perpendicular to the glenoid, limiting shear force production. The 135 deg horizontal target was particularly unstable for unimanual pushing (143{\%} less stable than the 45 deg target), and the applied force for this task acts parallel to the glenoid, likely creating shear forces or limiting compressive forces. Pushing was less stable than pulling (all targets except sagittal 170 deg for both task types and horizontal 45 deg for bimanual) (p {\textless} 0.01), which is consistent with prior reports. For example, unimanual pushing at the 90 deg horizontal target was 197{\%} less stable than unimanual pulling. There were limited stability benefits to task placement for pushing, and larger stability benefits may be seen from converting tasks from push to pull rather than optimizing task layout. There was no difference in stability between bimanual and unimanual tasks, suggesting no stability benefit to bimanual operation.},

abstract = {Exoskeleton robots are generally used for rehabilitation and load-carrying applications. Stable and flexible walking with minimal energy consumption of the human body is achieved by the compliant operation of the human joints. Essentially, the stiffness of the human ankle joint varies continuously, while the stiffness of the knee and hip joints remains nearly constant during loading phases of the walking cycles. With inspiration from the human leg biomechanics, a new biomimetic compliant lower limb exoskeleton robot (BioComEx) was constructed and its preliminary experimental tests were carried out in this paper. A variable stiffness actuator was developed for the ankle joint of BioComEx, and series elastic actuator designs were employed in the knee and hip joints of the robot. The joint actuators of BioComEx were designed longitudinally in order to be embedded inside of the thigh and shank leg segments for the compactness. Separate force sensors were employed in each segment of the robot for the modularity of the control strategies. Since the exoskeletons can be used for both load-carrying and rehabilitation, the developed robot was tested in both human-in-charge and robot-in-charge modes, respectively. The robot needs to mimic movement of healthy user joints in the human-in-charge mode and maximize the compliance between the user and robot; thus, the interaction forces should be reduced as possible. Hence, a modular closed-loop impedance control algorithm was developed for this mode. On the other hand, in the robot-in-charge mode, the robot joints need to track predefined gait references to make the patient walk. PID position control algorithm was chosen for preliminary test of the robot in this mode. Experimental results show that BioComEx is sufficiently satisfactory for walking applications of healthy and paralyzed users.},

abstract = {Robotic devices have been shown to be efficacious in the delivery of therapy to treat upper limb motor impairment following stroke. However, the application of this technology to other types of neurological injury has been limited to case studies. In this paper, we present a multi degree of freedom robotic exoskeleton, the MAHI Exo II, intended for rehabilitation of the upper limb following incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). We present details about the MAHI Exo II and initial findings from a clinical evaluation of the device with eight subjects with incomplete SCI who completed a multi-session training protocol. Clinical assessments show significant gains when comparing pre- and post-training performance in functional tasks. This paper explores a range of robotic measures capturing movement quality and smoothness that may be useful in tracking performance, providing as feedback to the subject, or incorporating into an adaptive training protocol. Advantages and disadvantages of the various investigated measures are discussed with regard to the type of movement segmentation that can be applied to the data collected during unassisted movements where the robot is backdriven and encoder data is recorded for post-processing. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {We have been developing an exoskeleton robot (ExoRob) for assisting daily upper limb movements (i.e., shoulder, elbow and wrist). In this paper we have focused on the development of a 2DOF ExoRob to rehabilitate elbow joint flexion/extension and shoulder joint internal/external rotation, as a step toward the development of a complete (i.e., 3DOF) shoulder motion assisted exoskeleton robot. The proposed ExoRob is designed to be worn on the lateral side of the upper arm in order to provide naturalistic movements at the level of elbow (flexion/extension) and shoulder joint internal/external rotation. This paper also focuses on the modeling and control of the proposed ExoRob. A kinematic model of ExoRob has been developed based on modified Denavit-Hartenberg notations. In dynamic simulations of the proposed ExoRob, a novel nonlinear sliding mode control technique with exponential reaching law and computed torque control technique is employed, where trajectory tracking that corresponds to typical rehab (passive) exercises has been carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed model and controller. Simulated results show that the controller is able to drive the ExoRob efficiently to track the desired trajectories, which in this case consisted in passive arm movements. Such movements are used in rehabilitation and could be performed very efficiently with the developed ExoRob and the controller. Experiments were carried out to validate the simulated results as well as to evaluate the performance of the controller. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {Demand for highly compliant mechanical sensors for use in the fields of robotics and wearable electronics has been constantly rising in recent times. Carbon based materials, and especially, carbon nanotubes, have been widely studied as a candidate piezoresistive sensing medium in these devices due to their favorable structural morphology. In this paper three different carbon based materials, namely carbon black, graphene nano-platelets, and multi-walled carbon nanotubes, were utilized as large stretch sensors capable of measuring stretches over 250{\%}. These stretch sensors can be used in robotic hands/arms to determine the angular position of joints. Analysis was also carried out to understand the effect of the morphologies of the carbon particles on the electromechanical response of the sensors. Sensors with gauge factors ranging from one to 1.75 for strain up to 200{\%} were obtained. Among these sensors, the stretch sensors with carbon black/silicone composite were found to have the highest gauge factor while demonstrating acceptable hysteresis in most robotic hand applications. The highly flexible stretch sensors demonstrated in this work show high levels of compliance and conformance making them ideal candidates as sensors for soft robotics.},

abstract = {Electronic Textiles (e-textiles) are fabrics that feature electronics and interconnections woven into them, presenting physical flexibility and typical size that cannot be achieved with other existing electronic manufacturing techniques. Components and interconnections are intrinsic to the fabric and thus are less visible and not susceptible of becoming tangled or snagged by surrounding objects. E-textiles can also more easily adapt to fast changes in the computational and sensing requirements of any specific application, this one representing a useful feature for power management and context awareness. The vision behind wearable computing foresees future electronic systems to be an integral part of our everyday outfits. Such electronic devices have to meet special requirements concerning wearability. Wearable systems will be characterized by their ability to automatically recognize the activity and the behavioral status of their own user as well as of the situation around her/him, and to use this information to adjust the systems' configuration and functionality. This review focuses on recent advances in the field of Smart Textiles and pays particular attention to the materials and their manufacturing process. Each technique shows advantages and disadvantages and our aim is to highlight a possible trade-off between flexibility, ergonomics, low power consumption, integration and eventually autonomy. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

@article{Machado2010,
abstract = {The aim of this work is to develop a dynamic model for the biological human knee joint. The model is formulated in the framework of multibody systems methodologies, as a system of two bodies, the femur and the tibia. for the purpose of describing the formulation, the relative motion of the tibia with respect to the femur is considered. Due to their higher stiffness compared to that of the articular cartilages, the femur and tibia are considered as rigid bodies. The femur and tibia cartilages are considered to be deformable structures with specific material characteristics. The rotation and gliding motions of the tibia relative to the femur cannot be modeled with any conventional kinematic joint, but rather in terms of the action of the knee ligaments and potential contact between the bones. Based on medical imaging techniques, the femur and tibia profiles in the sagittal plane are extracted and used to define the interface geometric conditions for contact. When a contact is detected, a continuous nonlinear contact force law is applied which calculates the contact forces developed at the interface as a function of the relative indentation between the two bodies. The four basic cruciate and collateral ligaments present in the knee are also taken into account in the proposed knee joint model, which are modeled as nonlinear elastic springs. The forces produced in the ligaments, together with the contact forces, are introduced into the system's equations of motion as external forces. In addition, an external force is applied on the center of mass of the tibia, in order to actuate the system mimicking a normal gait motion. Finally, numerical results obtained from computational simulations are used to address the assumptions and procedures adopted in this study. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

abstract = {This study presents the influences of key processing parameters on the resulting material properties of fused-deposition-modeled (FDM) polylactic acid (PLA) components tested in torsion. A reduced experimental matrix was produced through the use of a Taguchi L9 orthogonal array with three parameters at three levels each. The processing parameters included the layer thickness, infill density, and postprocessing heat-treatment time at 100°C. Testing of components at varying times is conducted to facilitate heat-treatment time testing range and show the effects of prolonged heating. The layer thickness and infill are tested across the entire useful range available for the FDM machine used. Shear stress–strain response curves are acquired and average ultimate shear strength, 0.2{\%} yield strength, proportional limit, shear modulus, and fracture strain are calculated for each run. An analysis of results via regression analysis is used to determine influences levels of parameters of the mechanical properties. The layer thickness and infill density are shown to be of high importance when optimizing for strength, with heat-treatment implementation slightly improving the resulting properties. Ductility is mainly affected by infill and heat treatment, with layer thickness having only a slight effect on the fracture strain achieved. Recommendations are made based on results of a method to optimize for either strength or ductility and how to compromise between recommended settings when a balance between the two is desired. The ability to produce parts with mechanical properties at or near those of bulk PLA is shown.},

abstract = {Kinematic compatibility is of paramount importance in wearable robotic and exoskeleton design. Misalignments between exoskeletons and anatomical joints of the human body result in interaction forces which make wearing the exoskeleton uncomfortable and even dangerous for the human. In this paper we present a kinematically compatible design of an exoskeleton hip to reduce kinematic incompatibilities, so called macro- and micro-misalignments, between the human's and exoskeleton's joint axes, which are caused by inter-subject variability and articulation. The resulting design consists of five revolute, three prismatic and one ball joint. Design parameters such as range of motion and joint velocities are calculated based on the analysis of human motion data acquired by motion capture systems. We show that the resulting design is capable of self-aligning to the human hip joint in all three anatomical planes during operation and can be adapted along the dorsoventral and mediolateral axis prior to operation. Calculation of the forward kinematics and FEM-simulation considering kinematic and musculoskeletal constraints proved sufficient mobility and stiffness of the system regarding the range of motion, angular velocity and torque admissibility needed to provide 50 {\%} assistance for an 80 kg person.},

abstract = {A three-dimensional, neuromusculoskeletal model of the body was combined with dynamic optimization theory to simulate normal walking on level ground. The body was modeled as a 23 degree-of-freedom mechanical linkage, actuated by 54 muscles. The dynamic optimization problem was to calculate the muscle excitation histories, muscle forces, and limb motions subject to minimum metabolic energy expenditure per unit distance traveled. Muscle metabolic energy was calculated by summing five terms: the basal or resting heat, activation heat, maintenance heat, shortening heat, and the mechanical work done by all the muscles in the model. The gait cycle was assumed to be symmetric; that is, the muscle excitations for the right and left legs and the initial and terminal states in the model were assumed to be equal. Importantly, a tracking problem was not solved. Rather, only a set of terminal constraints was placed on the states of the model to enforce repeatability of the gait cycle. Quantitative comparisons of the model predictions with patterns of body-segmental displacements, ground-reaction forces, and muscle activations obtained from experiment show that the simulation reproduces the salient features of normal gait. The simulation results suggest that minimum metabolic energy per unit distance traveled is a valid measure of walking performance.},

However, an understanding of how tissue cells-including fibroblasts, myocytes, neurons, and other cell types-sense matrix stiffness is just emerging with quantitative studies of cells adhering to gels (or to other cells) with which elasticity can be tuned to approximate that of tissues. Key roles in molecular pathways are played by adhesion complexes and the actin-myosin cytoskeleton, whose contractile forces are transmitted through transcellular structures. The feedback of local matrix stiffness on cell state likely has important implications for development, differentiation, disease, and regeneration.},

abstract = {Knee forces directly affect arthroplasty component survivorship, wear of articular bearing surfaces, and integrity of the bone-implant interface. It is not known which activities generate forces within a range that is physiologically desirable but not high enough to jeopardize the survivorship of the prosthetic components. We implanted three patients with an instrumented tibial prosthesis and measured knee forces and moments in vivo during exercise and recreational activities. As expected, stationary bicycling generated low tibial forces, whereas jogging and tennis generated high peak forces. On the other hand, the golf swing generated unexpectedly high forces, especially in the leading knee. Exercise on the elliptical trainer generated lower forces than jogging but not lower than treadmill walking. These novel data allow for a more scientific approach to recommending activities after TKA. In addition, these data can be used to develop clinically relevant structural and tribologic testing, which may result in activity-specific knee designs such as a knee design more tolerant of golfing by optimizing the conflicting needs of increased rotational laxity and conformity. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons.},

abstract = {In the field of robotics, sensors are crucial in enabling the interaction between robots and their users. To ensure this interaction, sensors mainly measure the user's strength, and based on this, wearable robots are controlled. In this paper, we propose a novel three-axis force/torque sensor for wearable robots that is compact and has a high load capacity. The bolt and nut combination of the proposed sensor is designed to measure high-load weights, and the simple structure of this combination allows the sensor to be compact and light. Additionally, to measure the three-axis force/torque, we design three capacitance-sensing cells. These cells are arranged in parallel to measure the difference in capacitance between the positive and negative electrodes. From the capacitance change measured by these sensing cells, force/torque information is converted through deep neural network calibration. The sensing point can also be confirmed using the geometric and kinematic relation of the sensor. The proposed sensor is manufactured through a simple and inexpensive process using cheap and simply structured components. The performance of the sensor, such as its repeatability and capacity, is evaluated using several experimental setups. In addition, the sensor is applied to a wearable robot to measure the force of an artificial muscle.},

abstract = {External fixation of the elbow requires identification of the elbow rotation axis, but the accuracy of traditional landmarks (capitellum and trochlea) on fluoroscopy is limited. The relative distance (RD) of the humerus may be helpful as additional landmark. The first aim of this study was to determine the optimal RD that corresponds to an on-axis lateral image of the elbow. The second aim was to assess whether the use of the optimal RD improves the surgical accuracy to identify the elbow rotation axis on fluoroscopy. CT scans of elbows from five volunteers were used to simulate fluoroscopy; the actual rotation axis was calculated with CT-based flexion–extension analysis. First, three observers measured the optimal RD on simulated fluoroscopy. The RD is defined as the distance between the dorsal part of the humerus and the projection of the posteromedial cortex of the distal humerus, divided by the anteroposterior diameter of the humerus. Second, eight trauma surgeons assessed the elbow rotation axis on simulated fluoroscopy. In a preteaching session, surgeons used traditional landmarks. The surgeons were then instructed how to use the optimal RD as additional landmark in a postteaching session. The deviation from the actual rotation axis was expressed as rotational and translational error (±SD). Measurement of the RD was robust and easily reproducible; the optimal RD was 45{\%}. The surgeons identified the elbow rotation axis with a mean rotational error decreasing from 7.6{\textordmasculine} ± 3.4{\textordmasculine} to 6.7{\textordmasculine} ± 3.3{\textordmasculine} after teaching how to use the RD. The mean translational error decreased from 4.2 ± 2.0 to 3.7 ± 2.0 mm after teaching. The humeral RD as additional landmark yielded small but relevant improvements. Although fluoroscopy-based external fixator alignment to the elbow remains prone to error, it is recommended to use the RD as additional landmark.},

This work reviews the frictional and the electrical properties of the skin surface, with an emphasis on the measurement of the friction coefficient. Many designs have been utilized and past studies have included numerous probe geometries and materials. An advantage of tribological measurements is that they offer a non-invasive way to quantitatively measure skin hydration and health. Skin friction seems to be dependent on several factors such as age, anatomical site, and skin hydration. The design of the measuring instrument and the probe geometry and material also affect the friction measurement. Clinically, it was found that skin with decreased hydration, as with psoriasis or atopic dermatitis, had a reduced friction coefficient and an increased resistance to current flow. Chemical treatments influence skin hydration level and affect the friction coefficient. Application of water and isopropyl alcohol increased and decreased the friction coefficient, respectively. A discussion of emollients and moisturizers is included with an emphasis on describing ?greasiness? and ?stickiness? quantitatively. Tribological measurements are a multi-faceted and non-invasive way to quantify skin hydration and health.},

abstract = {Low-Back Pain (LBP) affects a large portion of the working population. Preventive exoskeletons have been proposed to reduce the moments on the lower back, specifically around the lumbosacral (L5/S1) joint. High correlation has been shown, between reducing the moments around the L5/S1 joint and intervertebral compression forces, which in turn have been identified as a risk factor for developing LBP. However, most passive back support exoskeletons use rigid plates or stiff beams to support the spine that limit the range of motion of the wearer. A large range of motion and versatility are especially desirable for industrial applications. To overcome these limitations, a passive biomimetic exo-spine has been designed, modelled and an initial prototype tested. Its potential to allow for a large range of motion, whilst at the same time limiting the most extreme and potentially harmful postures has been shown.},

abstract = {Wearable technology has gained increasing popularity in the applications of healthcare, sports science, and biomedical engineering in recent years. Because of its convenient nature, the wearable technology is particularly useful in the acquisition of the physiological signals. Specifically, the (surface electromyography) sEMG systems, which measure the muscle activation potentials, greatly benefit from this technology in both clinical and industrial applications. However, the current wearable sEMG systems have several drawbacks including inefficient noise cancellation, insufficient measurement quality, and difficult integration to customized applications. Additionally, none of these sEMG data acquisition systems can detect sEMG signals (i.e., contractions), which provides a valuable environment for further studies such as human machine interaction, gesture recognition, and fatigue tracking. To this end, we introduce an embedded, eight channel, noise canceling, wireless, wearable sEMG data acquisition system with adaptive muscle contraction detection. Our design consists of two stages, which are the sEMG sensors and the multichannel data acquisition unit. For the first stage, we propose a low cost, dry, and active sEMG sensor that captures the muscle activation potentials, a data acquisition unit that evaluates these captured multichannel sEMG signals and transmits them to a user interface. In the data acquisition unit, the sEMG signals are processed through embedded, adaptive methods in order to reject the power line noise and detect the muscle contractions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our sEMG sensor outperforms a widely used commercially available product and our data acquisition system achieves 4.583 dB SNR gain with accuracy in the detection of the contractions.},

By processing the electromyography (EMG) signals collected from human muscles, the limb impedance could be extracted and transferred to robots. The existing impedance transfer interfaces rely only on visual feedback and, thus, may be insufficient for skill transfer in a sophisticated environment. In this paper, physical haptic feedback mechanism is introduced to result in muscle activity that would generate EMG signals in a natural manner, in order to achieve intuitive human impedance transfer through a designed coupling interface. Relevant processing methods are integrated into the system, including the spectral collaborative representation-based classifications method used for hand motion recognition; fast smooth envelop and dimensionality reduction algorithm for arm endpoint stiffness estimation.

The developed interface has the following functionalities: 1) it transfers human arm impedance adaptive motion to the robot intuitively; 2) it senses human motion signals that are decoded into human hand gesture and arm endpoint stiffness that ia employed for natural human robot interaction; and 3) it provides human tutor haptic feedback for enhanced teaching experience.

abstract = {In the physical human-robot interaction system, improving transparency performance which allows humans to move as if there is no robot is a challenging topic. In general physical human-robot interaction, the multiaxial force sensor is used to control the robot. However the signal measured from the force sensor involves not only the force applied to the robot by the human motion intention but also the influence of the natural force feedback between the robot and the human hand due to the motion of the robot. Therefore, in order to improve the transparency performance, it is necessary to consider the dynamics of the human hand as well as the dynamics of the robot. In this paper, an novel algorithm to improve transparency performance is proposed. The proposed algorithm uses only the multiaxial force sensor and compensates the natural force feedback by using the human hand impedance and further improves the transparency performance which has a limitation adjusting admittance parameters. The validity of the proposed algorithm is described through the system model analysis and the experiment using the hydraulic upper limb exoskeleton.},

abstract = {Background: Even though walking can be sustained for great distances, considerable energy is required for plantarflexion around the instant of opposite leg heel contact. Different groups attempted to reduce metabolic cost with exoskeletons but none could achieve a reduction beyond the level of walking without exoskeleton, possibly because there is no consensus on the optimal actuation timing. The main research question of our study was whether it is possible to obtain a higher reduction in metabolic cost by tuning the actuation timing. Methodology/Principal Findings: We measured metabolic cost by means of respiratory gas analysis. Test subjects walked with a simple pneumatic exoskeleton that assists plantarflexion with different actuation timings. We found that the exoskeleton can reduce metabolic cost by 0.18±0.06 W kg-1 or 6±2{\%} (standard error of the mean) (p = 0.019) below the cost of walking without exoskeleton if actuation starts just before opposite leg heel contact. Conclusions/Significance: The optimum timing that we found concurs with the prediction from a mathematical model of walking. While the present exoskeleton was not ambulant, measurements of joint kinetics reveal that the required power could be recycled from knee extension deceleration work that occurs naturally during walking. This demonstrates that it is theoretically possible to build future ambulant exoskeletons that reduce metabolic cost, without power supply restrictions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Malcolm et al.},

The hybrid actuator was experimentally measured in terms of bending and force tests to demonstrate the utility of this design.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE. Immobility due to movement impairments causes many secondary conditions that are a threat to a person's health and quality of life. Wearable robotic mobility aids such as exoskeletons and exosuits are a promising technique to tackle immobility. These devices are attached to the human with cuffs. However, the physical interaction at the human-robot interface is not yet well understood. Misplacement and compression of soft tissue diminish the efficiency of the robot and the comfort for the human. We developed a measurement method that allows us to simultaneously measure cuff interaction forces in normal and tangential direction. The measurement setup was validated in a friction test bench. The test-retest reliability was evaluated in an isolated attachment cuff mounted on a human forearm. Force measurements were repeatable, with error ranges up to 28.7{\%} or 7.8 N in normal, 28.7{\%} or 2.3 N in tangential direction. Our method is the first approach that simultaneously measures normal and tangential forces at the physical interface of wearable robots. The test-retest reliability is within the range of methods that assess only normal forces.},

abstract = {The main goal of this work is to design and build an economical and efficient mobility-device that is external to the user and is able to improve motor performance by supporting task-specific movement. Increasing numbers of people of all ages are affected by injuries that result in restricted movement. These people are victims of car or other accidents, children with congenital pathologies and others suffering from traumas caused by lifting and carrying heavy loads in various work places. All these situations require a simple and cost-effective solution. There are few existing technologies that allow people to recover from or, potentially, to prevent these serious injuries. The few that do exist at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7 or higher are prohibitively expensive (US{\$}100k-150k). The developed prototype design has four main benefits when compared to similar existing devices. One is the improvement of the gait-cycle allowing the wearer to perform more natural movements. The new design also has more flexible joints to give the wearer more comfort while performing complex movements. The integrated micro-controller and sensors allow the device to operate safely without reacting to unintentional motions (coughing, sneezing and shivering). Another benefit is the scalability of the device: it is adaptable to the unique physiology of any person. The prototype currently has limited operation endurance, in the order of 30 minutes with a single battery and without recharging the energy source. Current research is aimed at designing a more effective energy system to extend operation endurance.},

abstract = {The choice of non-anthropomorphic kinematic solutions for wearable robots is motivated both by the necessity of improving the ergonomics of physical Human-Robot Interaction and by the chance of exploiting the intrinsic dynamical properties of the robotic structure so to improve its performances. Under these aspects, this new class of robotic solutions is potentially advantageous over the one of anthropomorphic robotic orthoses. However, the process of kinematic synthesis of non-anthropomorphic wearable robots can be too complex to be solved uniquely by relying on conventional synthesis methods, due to the large number of open design parameters. A systematic approach can be useful for this purpose, since it allows to obtain the complete list of independent kinematic solutions with desired properties. In this perspective, this paper presents a method, which allows to generalize the problem of kinematic synthesis of a non-anthropomorphic wearable robot for the assistance of a specified set of contiguous body segments. The methodology also includes two novel tests, specifically devised to solve the problem of enumeration of kinematic structures of wearable robots: the HR-isomorphism and the HR-degeneracy tests. This method has been implemented to derive the atlas of independent kinematic solutions suitable to be used for the kinematic design of a planar wearable robot for the lower limbs. {\textcopyright} 2011 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {A critical issue in the control of exoskeleton systems is unknown nonlinear dynamic properties of the system. The improper estimation of those unknown properties can cause considerable human-exoskeleton interaction force during human's movements. It is really challenging to exactly estimate the parameters of dynamic models. In this paper, we propose a novel exoskeleton control algorithm to both compensate for the dynamic uncertainty error and minimize the human-exoskeleton interaction force. We have built a virtual torque controller based on dynamic models of a lower exoskeleton and have used an approximation of a Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network to compensate for the dynamic uncertainty error. By doing so, we avoid using complicated force sensors installed on the human-exoskeleton interface and minimize the physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) force. Moreover, we introduce the prototype of our exoskeleton system, called `PRMI' exoskeleton system. Finally, we validated the proposed algorithm on this system, and the experimental results show that the proposed control algorithm provides a good control quality for the `PRMI' exoskeleton system by compensating for dynamic uncertainty error.},

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

abstract = {Storm damage in production forests constitutes a major source of economic loss world wide, yet the retrieval of salvageable timber remains problematic. In particular, an inability to anticipate when sapstain and degrade will appear hampers the planning of log recovery operations. A study was conducted to monitor the deterioration of fallen trees following two winter storms causing wind and snow damage in a Pinus radiata plantation forest in the upper South Island of New Zealand. Percentage sapstain, incidence of basidiomycete decay fungi, and frequency of bark beetle infestation increased, while percentage sapwood moisture content decreased, over a period of 1 year. These changes proceeded more rapidly in fallen trees that were severed at stump height, to simulate breakage, than in those that were left partially rooted. There was little beetle activity at the time of the storms, but Arhopalus ferus (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), and Hylastes ater, Hylurgus ligniperda and Pachycotes peregrinus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae), were collected in flight traps during the following spring and summer. The predominant fungal species associated with sapstain was Diplodia pinea, while Ophiostoma piceae and Grosmannia huntii were isolated near the end of the period. The main decay fungi obtained were Phlebiopsis gigantea, Stereum sanguinolentum, and Schizophyllum commune. A generalized linear mixed model was constructed to predict the development of sapstain in fallen trees for conditions prevailing during the study after a storm at the same time of year. According to the model, a 10. m long butt log of 22. cm mid length diameter will have minimal stain ({\textless}10{\%} of the cross sectional area affected) when cut from severed stems up to 4 months after the storm; if taken from still-rooted trees this period will extend to 1 year. However, because of large between-tree variation, economically productive log recovery will also depend on the proportion of trees that lie below an acceptable sapstain threshold. Further research is needed to determine regional and seasonal influences on the development of sapstain in fallen trees. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Exoskeletons are progressively reaching homes and workplaces, allowing interaction with virtual environments, remote control of robots, or assisting human operators in carrying heavy loads. Their design is however still a challenge as these robots, being mechanically linked to the operators who wear them, have to meet ergonomic constraints besides usual robotic requirements in terms of workspace, speed, or efforts. They have in particular to fit the anthropometry and mobility of their users. This traditionally results in numerous prototypes which are progressively fitted to each individual person. In this paper, we propose instead to validate the design of a hand exoskeleton in a fully digital environment, without the need for a physical prototype. The purpose of this study is thus to examine whether finger kinematics are altered when using a given hand exoskeleton. Therefore, user specific musculoskeletal models were created and driven by a motion capture system to evaluate the fingers' joint kinematics when performing two industrial related tasks. The kinematic chain of the exoskeleton was added to the musculoskeletal models and its compliance with the hand movements was evaluated. Our results show that the proposed exoskeleton design does not influence fingers' joints angles, the coefficient of determination between the model with and without exoskeleton being consistently high (R2¯=0.93) and the nRMSE consistently low (nRMSE¯ = 5.42°). These results are promising and this approach combining musculoskeletal and robotic modeling driven by motion capture data could be a key factor in the ergonomics validation of the design of orthotic devices and exoskeletons prior to manufacturing. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Background One of the most popular robot assisted rehabilitation devices used is the Lokomat. Unfortunately, not much is known about the behaviors exhibited by subjects in this device. The goal of this study was to evaluate the kinematic patterns of individuals walking inside the Lokomat compared to those demonstrated on a treadmill. Methods Six healthy subjects walked on a treadmill and inside the Lokomat while the motions of the subject and Lokomat were tracked. Joint angles and linear motion were determined for Lokomat and treadmill walking. We also evaluated the variability of the patterns, and the repeatability of measuring techniques. Findings The overall kinematics in the Lokomat are similar to those on a treadmill, however there was significantly more hip and ankle extension, and greater hip and ankle range of motion in the Lokomat (P {\textless} 0.05). Additionally, the linear movement of joints was reduced in the Lokomat. Subjects tested on repeated sessions presented consistent kinematics, demonstrating the ability to consistently setup and test subjects. Interpretation The reduced degrees of freedom in the Lokomat are believed to be the reason for the specific kinematic differences. We found that despite being firmly attached to the device there was still subject movement relative to the Lokomat. This led to variability in the patterns, where subjects altered their gait pattern from step to step. These results are clinically important as a variable step pattern has been shown to be a more effective gait training strategy than one which forces the same kinematic pattern in successive steps. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE. Three-dimensional Digital Image Correlation (3D-DIC) is a non-contact optical-numerical technique for evaluating the dynamic mechanical behavior at the surface of structures and materials, including biological tissues. 3D-DIC can be used to extract shape and full-field displacements and strains with high resolution, at various length scales. While various commercial and academic 3D-DIC software exist, the field lacks 3D-DIC packages which offer straightforward calibration and data-merging solutions for multi-view analysis, which is particularly desirable in biomedical applications. To address these limitations, we present MultiDIC, an open-source MATLAB toolbox, featuring the first 3D-DIC software specifically dedicated to multi-view setups. MultiDIC integrates robust two-dimensional subset-based DIC software with specially tailored calibration procedures, to reconstruct the dynamic behavior of surfaces from multiple stereo-pairs. MultiDIC contains novel algorithms to automatically merge meshes from multiple stereo-pairs, and to compute and visualize 3D shape and full-field motion, deformation, and strain. User interfaces provide capabilities to perform 3D-DIC analyses without interacting with MATLAB syntax, while stand-alone functions also allow proficient MATLAB users to write custom scripts for specific experimental requirements. This paper discusses the challenges underlying multi-view 3D-DIC, details the proposed solutions, and describes the algorithms implemented in MultiDIC. The performance of MultiDIC is tested using a low-cost experimental system featuring a 360° 12-camera setup. The software and system are evaluated using measurement of a cylindrical object with known geometry subjected to rigid body motion and measurement of the lower limb of a human subject. The findings confirm that shape, motion, and full-field deformations and strains can be accurately measured, and demonstrate the feasibility of MultiDIC in multi-view in-vivo biomedical applications.},

abstract = {This study is aimed at the analysis of articular contact in a three-dimensional mathematical model of the human knee-joint. In particular the effect of articular contact on the passive motion characteristics is assessed in relation to experimentally obtained joint kinematics. Two basically different mathematical contact descriptions were compared for this purpose. One description was for rigid contact and one for deformable contact. The description of deformable contact is based on a simplified theory for contact of a thin elastic layer on a rigid foundation. The articular cartilage was described either as a linear elastic material or as a non-linear elastic material. The contact descriptions were introduced in a mathematical model of the knee. The locations of the ligament insertions and the geometry of the articular surfaces were obtained from a joint specimen of which experimentally determined kinematic data were available, and were used as input for the model. The ligaments were described by non-linear elastic line elements. The mechanical properties of the ligaments and the articular cartilage were derived from literature data. Parametric model evaluations showed that, relative to rigid articular contact, the incorporation of deformable contact did not alter the motion characteristics in a qualitative sense, and that the quantitative changes were small. Variation of the elasticity of the elastic layer revealed that decreasing the surface stiffness caused the ligaments to relax and, as a consequence, increased the joint laxity, particularly for axial rotation. The difference between the linear and the non-linear deformable contact in the knee model was very small for moderate loading conditions. The motion characteristics simulated with the knee model compared very well with the experiments. It is concluded that for simulation of the passive motion characteristics of the knee, the simplified description for contact of a thin linear elastic layer on a rigid foundation is a valid approach when aiming at the study of the motion characteristics for moderate loading conditions. With deformable contact in the knee model, geometric conformity between the surfaces can be modelled as opposed to rigid contact which assumed only point contact.},

abstract = {Robotic rehabilitation has gained significant traction in recent years, due to the clinical demonstration of its efficacy in restoring function for upper extremity movements and locomotor skills, demonstrated primarily in stroke populations. In this paper, we present the design of MAHI Exo II, a robotic exoskeleton for the rehabilitation of upper extremity after stroke, spinal cord injury, or other brain injuries. The five degree-of-freedom robot enables elbow flexion-extension, forearm pronation-supination, wrist flexion-extension, and radial-ulnar deviation. The device offers several significant design improvements compared to its predecessor, MAHI Exo I. Specifically, issues with backlash and singularities in the wrist mechanism have been resolved, torque output has been increased in the forearm and elbow joints, a passive degree of freedom has been added to allow shoulder abduction thereby improving alignment especially for users who are wheelchair-bound, and the hardware now enables simplified and fast swapping of treatment side. These modifications are discussed in the paper, and results for the range of motion and maximum torque output capabilities of the new design and its predecessor are presented. The efficacy of the MAHI Exo II will soon be validated in a series of clinical evaluations with both stroke and spinal cord injury patients.},

It aims to compare and discuss the potentials of these different control algorithms, and specify future research direction. Included studies mainly come from selected papers in four review articles. To make selected studies complete and comprehensive, especially some recently-developed upper-limb robotic devices, a search was further conducted in IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, Scopus and Web of Science using keywords (‘upper limb*' or ‘upper body*') and (‘rehabilitation*' or ‘treatment*') and (‘robot*' or ‘device*' or ‘exoskeleton*'). The search is limited to English-language articles published between January 2013 and December 2017. Valuable references in related publications were also screened. Comparative analysis shows that high-level interaction control strategies can be implemented in a range of methods, mainly including impedance/admittance based strategies, adaptive control techniques, and physiological signal control. Even though the potentials of existing interactive control strategies have been demonstrated, it is hard to identify the one leading to maximum encouragement from human users. However, it is reasonable to suggest that future studies should combine different control strategies to be application specific, and deliver appropriate robotic assistance based on physical disability levels of human users.},

abstract = {Several mass-spring-damper models have been developed to study the response of the human body to the collision with the ground during hopping, trotting, or running. The mass, spring, and damper elements represent the masses, stiffness properties, and damping properties of hard and soft tissues. The masses that models are composed of are connected to each other via springs and dampers. The present paper reviews the various types of mass-spring-damper models including one-body and multi-body models. The models are further categorized as being either passive or active. In passive models, the mechanical properties (stiffness and damping) of soft tissues remain constant regardless of the type of footwear, ground stiffness, etc. In active models, the mechanical properties adapt to external loads. The governing equations of motion of all models as well as their parameters are presented. The specific ways that the models take account of the shoe-ground interactions are discussed as well. The methods used for determination of different modelling parameters are briefly surveyed. The advantages and disadvantages of the different types of mass-spring-damper models are also discussed. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of possible future research trends in the area of mass-spring-damper modelling. {\textcopyright} IMechE 2011.},

To this end, we propose a controller that provides the user's hip with a fraction of the nominal torque profile, adapted to the specific gait features of the user from Winter's reference data [34]. The assistive controller has been implemented on the ALEX II exoskeleton and tested on ten healthy subjects. Experimental results show that when assisted by the exoskeleton, users can reduce the muscle effort compared to free walking. Despite providing assistance only to the hip joint, both hip and ankle muscles significantly reduced their activation, indicating a clear tradeoff between hip and ankle strategy to propel walking.},

This research designed an estimation method of human joint torque by the kinetic human-machine interaction between the operator's elbow joint torque and the output of exoskeleton. The human elbow joint torque estimation was obtained by back propagation (BP) neural network with physiological and physical input elements including shoulder posture, elbow joint-related muscles activation, elbow joint position, and angular velocity. An elbow-powered exoskeleton was developed to verify the validity of the human elbow joint torque estimation. The average correlation coefficients of estimated and measured three shoulder joint angles are 97.9{\%}, 96.2{\%}, and 98.1{\%}, which show that estimated joint angles are consistent with the measured joint angle. The average root-mean-square error between estimated elbow joint torque and measured values is about 0.143Nm. The experiment results proved that the proposed strategy had good performance in human joint torque estimation.},

Meanwhile, Lower Limb joints and segments inclination, in the sagittal plane, were calculated indirectly, using IMUs' direct outputs. The outputs undergo several signal conditioning phases to remove noises and bias. Furthermore, misalignment effect on the raw data is removed by an on-body calibration of the sensors. Finally, for activity recognition purposes, T-test is used to prove that capturing motion along only one side of the lower limb is sufficient, due to redundancy in the corresponding features of the biomechanical signals (variables) of each leg.},

In recent years, the application of robotic exoskeleton has become more prominent as to provide alternative solutions for physically less incapable people (PLIP) support in their daily movements. Most common difficulties faced by PLIP are in sit-to-stand, ascending and descending staircases. Unlike industrial robots, the robotic exoskeleton systems need to consider a special design because they directly interact with human user. In the mechanical design of these systems, human and robotic suitable kinematics, wearer safety, human user comfort wearing, low inertia, and adaptability should be especially considered. Controllability, responsiveness, flexible and smooth motion generation, and safety should especially be considered in the controllers of exoskeleton systems. Furthermore, the controller should generate the motions in accordance with the human motion intention. This paper briefly reviews the lower-limb robotic exoskeleton systems. In the short review, it is focused to identify the brief history, basic concept, challenges, and future development of the robotic exoskeleton systems to assist the physically less incapable people (PLIP) in rising up, sitting, ascending and descending staircases.

The dimension of each segment is determined by hand anthropometric data obtained from measurements. Each finger is controlled by one motor to allow for independent movement of each finger, which is fundamental for hand dexterity. The design was guided by a proposed mechanical model (the exo-finger model) which was verified by simulation and validated by the movement recorded by prototype fingers.

They demonstrated the ability to generate significant force when pressurized and exhibited low impedance when un-actuated. To operate the soft robotic glove, a control hardware system was designed and included fluidic pressure sensors in line with the hydraulic actuators and a closed-loop controller to regulate the pressure. Demonstrations with the complete system were performed to evaluate the ability of the soft robotic glove to carry out gross and precise functional grasping.

abstract = {This paper introduces a novel control framework for an arm exoskeleton that takes into account force of the human arm. In contrast to the conventional exoskeleton controllers where the assistance is provided without considering the human arm biomechanical force manipulability properties, we propose a control approach based on the arm muscular manipulability. The proposed control framework essentially reshapes the anisotropic force manipulability into the endpoint force manipulability that is invariant with respect to the direction in the entire workspace of the arm. This allows users of the exoskeleton to perform tasks effectively in the whole range of the workspace, even in areas that are normally unsuitable due to the low force manipulability of the human arm. We evaluated the proposed control framework with real robot experiments where subjects wearing an arm exoskeleton were asked to move a weight between several locations. The results show that the proposed control framework does not affect the normal movement behavior of the users while effectively reduces user effort in the area of low manipulability. Particularly, the proposed approach augments the human arm force manipulability to execute tasks equally well in the entire workspace of the arm.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT
In vivo three-dimensional kinematics of the thoracic spine in trunk lateral bending with an intact rib cage and soft tissues has not been well documented. There is no quantitative data in the literature for lateral bending in consecutive thoracic spinal segments, and there has not been consensus on the patterns of coupled motion with lateral bending. 

PURPOSE
To demonstrate segmental ranges of motion (ROMs) in lateral bending and coupled motions of the thoracic spine. 

STUDY DESIGN
In vivo three-dimensional biomechanics study of the thoracic spine. 

PATIENT SAMPLE
Fifteen healthy male volunteers. 

OUTCOME MEASURES
Computed analysis by using voxel-based registration. 

METHODS
Participants underwent computed tomography of the thoracic spine in three supine positions: neutral, right maximum lateral bending, and left maximum lateral bending. The relative motions of vertebrae were calculated by automatically superimposing an image of vertebrae in a neutral position over images in bending positions, using voxel-based registration. Mean values of lateral bending were compared among the upper (T1–T2 to T3–T4), the middle-upper (T4–T5 to T6–T7), the middle-lower (T7–T8 to T9–T10), and the lower (T10–T11 to T12–L1) parts of the spine. 

RESULTS
At lateral bending, the mean ROM (±standard deviation) of T1 with respect to L1 was 15.6°±6.3° for lateral bending and 6.2°±4.8° for coupled axial rotation in the same direction as lateral bending. The mean lateral bending of each spinal segment with respect to the inferior adjacent vertebra was 1.4°±1.3° at T1–T2, 1.3°±1.2° at T2–T3, 1.4°±1.3° at T3–T4, 0.9°±0.9° at T4–T5, 0.8°±1.0° at T5–T6, 1.1°±1.1° at T6–T7, 1.7°±1.2° at T7–T8, 1.3°±1.2° at T8–T9, 1.6°±0.7° at T9–T10, 1.8°±0.8° at T10–T11, 2.3°±1.0° at T11–T12, and 2.2°±0.8° at T12–L1. The smallest and the largest amounts of lateral bending were observed in the middle-upper and the lower parts, respectively. There was no significant difference in lateral bending between the upper and the middle-lower parts. Coupled axial rotation of each segment was generally observed in the same direction as lateral bending. However, high variability was found at the T2–T3 to T5–T6 segments. Coupled flexion was observed at the upper and middle parts, and coupled extension was observed at the lower part. 

CONCLUSIONS
This study revealed in vivo three-dimensional motions of consecutive thoracic spinal segments in trunk lateral bending. The thoracolumbar segments significantly contributed to lateral bending. Coupled axial rotation generally occurred in the same direction with lateral bending. However, more variability was observed in the direction of coupled axial rotation at T2–T3 to T5–T6 segments in the supine position. These results are useful for understanding normal kinematics of the thoracic spine.},

abstract = {Abstract—Physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) is an important consideration in the design of rehabilitation exoskeletons. Series Elastic Actuators (SEAs) are seen as a promising method of introducing compliance and comfort to robotic exoskeletons. Recently, authors have proposed the use of elastomers in SEAs, rather than springs, but there is a dearth of literature comparing how the two compliant elements are perceived by humans. In this paper, we quantitatively and qualitatively compare human interaction with an elastomer and a spring in terms of comfort and motion smoothness, with the aim of informing future SEA design. Two mechanisms were designed to compare human interaction with a spring and elastomer, and a cross-over experimental design was used to help eliminate any learning effects. Overall, the elastomer appeared to be slightly more comfortable and allow slightly smoother motion than the spring, holding promise for the use of elastomers as a means of improving pHRI in exoskeletons actuated by SEAs.},

Extenders are defined as a class of robot manipulators worn by humans to increase mechanical strength while the wearer's intellect remains the central control system for manipulating the extender. The human, in physical contact with the extender, exchanges power and information signals with the extender. The present analysis focuses on the dynamics and control of human-robot interaction in the sense of the transfer of power and information signals. General models for the human, the extender, and the interaction between the human and extender are developed. The stability of the system of human, extender, and the object being manipulated is analyzed, and the conditions for stable maneuvers are derived. An expression for the extender performance is defined to quantify the force augmentation. The trade-off between stability and performance is described. The theoretical predictions are verified experimentally.},

abstract = {Impacts are instantaneous, computationally efficient approximations of collisions. Current impact models sacrifice important physical principles to achieve that efficiency, yielding qualitative and quantitative errors when applied to simultaneous impacts in spatial multibody systems. We present a new impact model that produces behaviour similar to that of a detailed compliant contact model, while retaining the efficiency of an instantaneous method. In our model, time and configuration are fixed, but the impact is resolved into distinct compression and expansion phases, themselves comprising sliding and rolling intervals. A constrained optimization problem is solved for each interval to compute incremental impulses while respecting physical laws and principles of contact mechanics. We present the mathematical model, algorithms for its practical implementation, and examples that demonstrate its effectiveness. In collisions involving materials of various stiffnesses, our model can be more than 20 times faster than integrating through the collision using a compliant contact model. This work extends the use of instantaneous impact models to scientific and engineering applications with strict accuracy requirements, where compliant contact models would otherwise be required. An open-source implementation is available in Simbody, a C++ multibody dynamics library widely used in biomechanical and robotic applications.},

It proposed a method to optimize the energy-stored element to decrease the hip joint moment in walking. EMG patterns, ground reaction force and motion data from one participant with complete spinal cord injury at T10 were recorded. A combined human-ES-EXO model was built and the stored-energy element including locations and stiffness of springs were optimized in AnyBody Modeling System. Significant correlations between experimental and simulated muscle activations in without springs condition proved that the model was feasible. With optimized energy-stored elements, the hip flexion moment decreased by 37.2{\%}, activations in abdominal muscles decreased and low back muscles slightly increased. The results suggest that ES-EXO could provide specific walking assistance for SCI patients through adjusting energy-stored elements according to patients' characteristics.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, computational neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) modeling and simulation of human movement, including effects of musculoskeletal geometries, multibody dynamics, and neuromuscular excitation to produce coordinated motion of segments has grown in complexity, fidelity, capabilities, and applications. Such capability stems from improved understanding and growth on two fronts: (A) increasing level of detail in developing constrained articulated-multibody models for the NMS system; coupled with (B) high-performance numerical time-stepping schema to realize stable, accurate, and real-time simulations of the intermittent, time-varying physical power interactions with the surrounding environment. Such computational modeling and simulation can now facilitate quantitative exploration of physical power interactions of NMS systems with their environment (including other articulated devices).In this chapter, we will survey some of these advances, with a particular focus on efforts on improving understanding of physical interactions of the human lower extremities with their physical environment (eg, walking, standing, bicycling). Paralleling the two thrusts, we will first review various biomechanical models, beginning with a succession of reduced-order low degree-of-freedom articulated-multibody-systemmodels, and culminating in the detailed NMS models. Then we will discuss the application settings in which the accuracy and stability of the numerical simulations can allow realistic "what-if" scenarios and parametric/optimization studies for design, development, and validation of articulated electromechanical devices (eg, robots) for intimate human-robot interactions.},

Here we consider two methods of introducing compliance to industrial manipulators: joint compliance and link compliance. To compare their effect on the maximum impact force, we study two designs of a 2D robot link: a rigid link with torsion spring at the joint and a uniform compliant link. The dynamic impact model is based on the Hertz contact model. The results show that the compliant joint solution could produce a larger impact force than that of the compliant link solution if the arm mass is larger than that of the end mass, given the same lateral stiffness and all other inertial parameters (e.g. mass). Simulations and experiment have been done and verified this conclusion. The research demonstrates that the compliant link solution could be a promising approach for addressing safety concerns of human robot interactions.},

abstract = {The resultant hip joint force, its orientation and the moments were measured in two patients during walking and running using telemetering total hip prostheses. One patient underwent bilateral joint replacement and a second patient, additionally suffering from a neuropathic disease and atactic gait patterns, received one instrumented hip implant. The joint loading was observed over the first 30 and 18 months, respectively, following implantation. In the first patient the median peak forces increased with the walking speed from about 280{\%} of the patient's body weight (BW) at 1 km h-1to approximately 480{\%} BW at 5 km h-1. Jogging and very fast walking both raised the forces to about 550{\%} BW; stumbling on one occasion caused magnitudes of 720{\%} BW. In the second patient median forces at 3 km h-1were about 410{\%} BW and a force of 870{\%} BW was observed during stumbling. During all types of activities, the direction of the peak force in the frontal plane changed only slightly when the force magnitude was high. Perpendicular to the long femoral axis, the peak force acted predominantly from medial to lateral. The component from ventral to dorsal increased at higher force magnitudes. In one hip in the first patient and in the second patient the direction of large forces approximated the average anteversion of the natural femur. The torsional moments around the stem of the implant were 40.3 Nm in the first patient and 24 Nm in the second. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

In particular, among many applications, wearable powered orthoses have been also introduced in the state of the art with the goal of providing lower-limb movement assistance in locomotion-related tasks (e.g.: walking, ascending/descending stairs) in scenarios of activities of daily living. In this paper we present a light-weight active orthosis endowed with two series elastic actuators for hip flexion–extension assistance. Along with the description of its mechatronic modules, we report the experimental characterization of the performance of the actuation and control system, as well as the usability test carried out with a healthy subject. Results showed a suitable dynamic behavior of the actuation unit: the closed-loop torque control bandwidth is about 15 Hz and the output impedance ranges from about 1 N m/rad to 35 N m/rad in the frequency spectrum between 0.2 and 3.2 Hz. Results from the tests with the healthy subject proved the overall system usability: the subject could walk with the device without being hindered and while he received a smooth assistive flexion–extension torque profile on both hip articulations.},

Several important performance indices are identified to accomplish the requirements of the ankle rehabilitation treatment and the wearable robot design. It is found that some of these indices are conflicting and hence in order to obtain an optimal robot design, these indices are required to be simultaneously optimized. Consequently, a multi-objective optimization scheme based on evolutionary algorithms is proposed in this paper to find a design which has optimum performance. The proposed design analysis can be generalized with modest efforts for the development of all the classes of parallel robots.},

Dielectric elastomer sensors (DESs) are excellent candidates forwearable humanmotion capture systems because of their intrinsic characteristics of softness, light weight, and compliance. In this paper, DESs were applied to measure all component motions of the wrist joints. Five sensors were mounted to different positions on the wrist, and each one is for one component motion. To find the best position to mount the sensors, the distribution of the muscles is analyzed. Even so, the component motions and the deformation of the sensors are coupled; therefore, a decoupling method was developed. By the decoupling algorithm, all component motions can be measured with a precision of 5°, which meets the requirements of general motion capture systems.},

Ankle stability was quantified in 2 degree-of-freedom (DOF) of the ankle, in both the sagittal and frontal planes. Importantly, the magnitude of negative environmental stiffness that the subjects could maintain stability is 4 times as great in the sagittal plane as in the frontal plane. In addition to managing a wider range of unstable environments in the sagittal plane, subjects were also more efficient at regaining stability after perturbation and less sensitive to changes in the environmental stiffness. Outcomes of this study would be beneficial to the design and control of robots physically interacting with human lower extremities, such as lower-limb exoskeletons and powered ankle-foot orthoses.},

abstract = {Metabolic rates can increase 21 times above resting levels during cycling with the majority attributed to muscular contractions. Metabolic estimates attained through gas exchange parameters are limited by the respiration rate and time delay with respect to these contractions. In contrast surface electromyography (EMG) contains instantaneous muscle contraction information at higher temporal resolutions. An adequate metabolic power-EMG relationship has not been established to use EMG as a metabolic estimate during dynamic activities. The purpose of this study was to establish a metabolic power-EMG relationship during non steady-state conditions. Participants cycled at workloads between 25 and 90{\%} V O2max while EMG and gas exchange were monitored. The EMG was resolved into intensities and total EMG intensity was calculated as the sum of intensities across all muscles for each pedal cycle. Metabolic power was estimated from gas exchange parameters and the mean total EMG intensity between breaths was calculated and used as breath-by-breath values. Comparisons were made between breath-by-breath resolutions of metabolic power and total EMG intensity. Different weighting coefficients were also applied to the EMG for each muscle to analyze the effects of different muscle weightings on metabolic power estimations. There was a significant correlation (r = 0.91) between estimates of metabolic power from EMG and gas exchange. Muscle weighting had a significant effect on metabolic power determination with the highest and lowest correlated estimates having the largest weightings on muscles proximal and distal to the knee respectively. This study demonstrates that EMG contains important information about the metabolic costs of muscle contractions and provides good predictions of metabolic changes during non steady-state conditions. Also, the importance of each muscle is workload dependent with inappropriate weightings reducing metabolic estimations. These findings have implications for future EMG applications as they provide more immediate, higher temporal resolution predictions of changes in metabolic power. {\textcopyright} 2013 Blake and Wakeling; licensee Springer.},

Recent developments have pointed towards compliant mechanisms and structures, due to their promising potential in terms of adaptability, safety, efficiency, and comfort. However, there still remain challenges to be solved before compliant lower limb exoskeletons can be deployed in real scenarios. In this review, we analysed 52 lower limb wearable exoskeletons, focusing on three main aspects of compliance: actuation, structure, and interface attachment components. We highlighted the drawbacks and advantages of the different solutions, and suggested a number of promising research lines. We also created and made available a set of data sheets that contain the technical characteristics of the reviewed devices, with the aim of providing researchers and end-users with an updated overview on the existing solutions.},

abstract = {A simple planar static model of the knee joint was developed to calculate effective moment arms for the quadriceps muscle. A pathway for the instantaneous center of rotation was chosen that gives realstic orientations of the femur relative to the tibia. Using the model, nonlinear force and moment equilibrium equations were solved at one degree increments for knee flexion angles from 0 (full extension) to 90°, yielding patellar orientation, patellofemoral contact force and patellar ligament force and direction with respect to both the tibial insertion point and the tibiofemoral contact point. The computer-derived results from this two-dimensional model agree with results from more complex models developed previously from experimentally obtained data. Due to our model's simplicity, however, the operation of the patellar mechanism as a lever as well as a spacer is clearly illustrated. Specifically, the thickness of the patella was found to increase the effective moment arm significantly only at flexions below 35° even though the actual moment arm exhibited an increase throughout the flexion range. Lengthening either the patella or the patellar ligament altered the force transmitted from the quadriceps to the patellar ligament, significantly increasing the effective moment arm at flexions greater than 25°. We conclude that the levering action of the patella is an essential mechanism of knee joint operation at moderate to high flexion angles. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {Spinal cord injury (SCI) typically manifests with a loss of sensorimotor control of the lower limbs. In order to overcome some of the disadvantages of chronic wheelchair use by such patients, robotic exoskeletons are an emerging technology that has the potential to transform the lives of patients. However, there are a number of points of contact between the robot and the user, which lead to interaction forces. In a recent study, the authors have shown that peak interaction forces are particularly prominent at the anterior aspect of the right leg. This study uses a similar experimental protocol with additional electromyography (EMG) analysis to examine whether such interaction forces are due to the muscular activity of the participant or the movement of the exoskeleton itself. Interestingly, the authors found that peak forces preceded peak EMG activity. This study did not find a significant correlation between EMG activity and force data, which would indicate that the interaction forces can largely be attributed to the movement of the exoskeleton itself. However, we also report significantly higher correlation coefficients in muscle/force pairs located at the anterior aspect of the right leg. In their previous research, the authors have shown peak interaction forces at the same locations, which suggests that muscular activity of the participant makes a more significant contribution to the interaction forces at these locations. The findings of this study are of significance for incomplete SCI patients, for whom EMG activity may provide an important input to an intuitive control schema.},

abstract = {Cost-effective preventive interventions are necessary for tackling the increasing number of hip fractures, which are frequently occuring as a serious consequence of osteoporosis. Several interventions have been available for preventing and treating osteoporosis. The aim of this study was to systematically review and critically appraise studies that assessed cost-effectiveness of hip protectors for the prevention of hip fractures and to investigate the effects of age, gender and residence situation on cost-effectiveness. A systematic review was conducted in order to identify economic evaluation studies examining the hip protector solely or compared to no treatment according to the Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Synthesis of results was performed to observe trends between the studies. Methodological quality of the studies was assessed by the use of the Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) instrument. A total of 15 economic evaluation studies were included for analysis. The methodological quality was high in most studies (13/15). The hip protector was solely evaluated in three studies and within 12 other studies compared with no intervention. All studies that investigated the cost-effectiveness in long-term care facilities revealed that hip protector use is a cost-effective strategy for the prevention of hip fractures in elderly. Cost-effectiveness was also observed in two studies that provided hip protectors in a geriatric hospital ward. Four studies included both community-dwelling residents and residents living in a long-term care facility in their study. These studies showed more variability regarding cost-effectiveness. One study did not report information regarding the residence situation of their cohort, but also observed cost-effectiveness. In conclusion, this review suggests that hip protectors are a cost-effective approach in the prevention of hip fractures in populations with high risk of hip fractures especially in long-term care facilities and a geriatric ward in a hospital.},

abstract = {The resultant hip joint force, its orientation and the moments were measured in two patients during walking and running using telemetering total hip prostheses. One patient underwent bilateral joint replacement and a second patient, additionally suffering from a neuropathic disease and atactic gait patterns, received one instrumented hip implant. The joint loading was observed over the first 30 and 18 months, respectively, following implantation. In the first patient the median peak forces increased with the walking speed from about 280{\%} of the patient's body weight (BW) at 1 km h-1to approximately 480{\%} BW at 5 km h-1. Jogging and very fast walking both raised the forces to about 550{\%} BW; stumbling on one occasion caused magnitudes of 720{\%} BW. In the second patient median forces at 3 km h-1were about 410{\%} BW and a force of 870{\%} BW was observed during stumbling. During all types of activities, the direction of the peak force in the frontal plane changed only slightly when the force magnitude was high. Perpendicular to the long femoral axis, the peak force acted predominantly from medial to lateral. The component from ventral to dorsal increased at higher force magnitudes. In one hip in the first patient and in the second patient the direction of large forces approximated the average anteversion of the natural femur. The torsional moments around the stem of the implant were 40.3 Nm in the first patient and 24 Nm in the second. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

The objective of this article is to emphasize two main points for future research. First, the design of future devices could be improved by exploiting biomechanical principles of animal locomotion. Two goals in exoskeleton research could particularly benefit from additional physiological perspective: (i) reduction in the metabolic energy expenditure of the user while wearing the device, and (ii) minimization of the power requirements for actuating the exoskeleton. Second, a reciprocal potential exists for robotic exoskeletons to advance our understanding of human locomotor physiology. Experimental data from humans walking and running with robotic exoskeletons could provide important insight into the metabolic cost of locomotion that is impossible to gain with other methods. Given the mutual benefits of collaboration, it is imperative that engineers and physiologists work together in future studies on robotic exoskeletons for human locomotion. {\textcopyright} 2007 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract = {Physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) is reliant on human actions and can be addressed by studying human upper-limb motions during interactions. Use of force myography (FMG) signals, which detect muscle contractions, can be useful in developing machine learning algorithms as controls. In this paper, a novel long-term calibrated FMG-based trained model is presented to estimate applied force in dynamic motion during real-time interactions between a human and a linear robot. The proposed FMG-based pHRI framework was investigated in new, unseen, real-time scenarios for the first time. Initially, a long-term reference dataset (multiple source distributions) of upper-limb FMG data was generated as five participants interacted with the robot applying force in five different dynamic motions. Ten other participants interacted with the robot in two intended motions to evaluate the out-of-distribution (OOD) target data (new, unlearned), which was different than the population data. Two practical scenarios were considered for assessment: i) a participant applied force in a new, unlearned motion (scenario 1), and ii) a new, unlearned participant applied force in an intended motion (scenario 2). In each scenario, few long-term FMG-based models were trained using a baseline dataset [reference dataset (scenario 1, 2) and/or a learnt participant dataset (scenario 1)] and a calibration dataset (collected during evaluation). Real-time evaluation showed that the proposed long-term calibrated FMG-based models (LCFMG) could achieve estimation accuracies of 80{\%}-94{\%} in all scenarios. These results are useful towards integrating and generalizing human activity data in a robot control scheme by avoiding extensive HRI training phase in regular applications.},

abstract = {The interface is a protective cover that establishes the contact between the prosthesis structure and the stump skin. The friction between the interface and the skin surface plays a key role to maintain adequate fit, in order to improve suspension and avoid skin injuries. The aim of this work is the study of the friction between the human skin and three common interface materials: block copolymer, silicone gel and elastomer. Coefficient of friction (COF) was assessed using a handheld probe, which allows the measurement of the contact forces during the sliding motion of the tested material against skin. Pull-off tests and contact angle measurements were also performed to quantify the adhesion force and surface energies, respectively. It was concluded that COF depends on the material nature but also on subject's specifications and anatomical region. Silicone elastomer showed the highest COF and adhesion energy. A correlation between these two variables was demonstrated.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new method for design of lower body exoskeleton based on optimizing the human-exoskeleton physical interface to improve user comfort. The approach is based on mechanisms designed to follow the natural trajectories of the human hip and knee joints as flexion angles vary during motion. The motion of the hip joint center (HJC) with variation of flexion angle was experimentally measured and the resulting trajectory was modeled. Similarly, the knee joint rolling and sliding motion was calculated based on analytical knee joint model. An exoskeleton mechanism able to follow the hip and knee joints centers' movements has been designed to cover the full flexion angle motion range and adopted in the lower body exoskeleton. The resulting design is shown to reduce human-exoskeleton interaction forces by 25.5 and 85.5 {\%} during hip flexion and abduction, respectively with bionic hip joint and to reduce human-exoskeleton interaction forces by 75.4 {\%} during knee flexion with bionic knee joint. The results of interaction forces led to a more ergonomic and comfortable way to wear exoskeleton system.},

abstract = {This contribution is concerned with joint angle calculation based on inertial measurement data in the context of human motion analysis. Unlike most robotic devices, the human body lacks even surfaces and right angles. Therefore, we focus on methods that avoid assuming certain orientations in which the sensors are mounted with respect to the body segments. After a review of available methods that may cope with this challenge, we present a set of new methods for: (1) joint axis and position identification; and (2) flexion/extension joint angle measurement. In particular, we propose methods that use only gyroscopes and accelerometers and, therefore, do not rely on a homogeneous magnetic field. We provide results from gait trials of a transfemoral amputee in which we compare the inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based methods to an optical 3D motion capture system. Unlike most authors, we place the optical markers on anatomical landmarks instead of attaching them to the IMUs. Root mean square errors of the knee flexion/extension angles are found to be less than 1° on the prosthesis and about 3° on the human leg. For the plantar/dorsiflexion of the ankle, both deviations are about 1°. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {In physical rehabilitation, exoskeleton assistive devices aim to restore lost motor functions of a patient suffering from neuromuscular or musculoskeletal disorders. These assis- tive devices are classified as operating in one of two modes: (1) passive mode, in which the exoskeleton passively moves its joints through the full range (or a subset) of the patient's motion during engagement, or (2) assist-as-needed (AAN) mode, in which the exoskeleton provides assistance to the joints of the patient, either by initiating the movements or assisting the patient's movements to complete the task at hand. Achieving high physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) transparency is an open problem for multiple degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) redundant exoskeletons. Using the EXO-UL8 exoskeleton, this study compares two multi-joint admittance control schemes (hy- per parameter- based, and Kalman Filter-based) with comfort optimization to improve human-exoskeleton transparency. The control schemes were tested by three healthy subjects who completed reaching tasks while assisted by the exoskeleton. Kinematic information in both joint and task space, as well as force- and torque-based power exchange between the human arm and exoskeleton, are collected and analyzed. The results show that the preliminary Kalman Filter-based control scheme matches the performance of the existing hyper parameter-based scheme, highlighting the potential of the Kalman Filter-based approach for additional performance.},

Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the development of wearable devices, the so-called exoskeletons, to assist elderly as well as patients with limb pathologies, for movement assistance and rehabilitation. In this paper, we review and discuss the state of the art of the lower limb exoskeletons that are mainly used for physical movement assistance and rehabilitation. An overview of the commonly used actuation systems is presented. According to different case studies, a classification and comparison between different types of actuators is conducted, such as hydraulic actuators, electrical motors, series elastic actuators, and artificial pneumatic muscles. Additionally, the mainly used control strategies in lower limb exoskeletons are classified and reviewed, based on three types of human-robot interfaces: the signals collected from the human body, the interaction forces between the exoskeleton and the wearer, and the signals collected from exoskeletons. Furthermore, the performances of several typical lower limb exoskeletons are discussed, and some assessment methods and performance criteria are reviewed. Finally, a discussion of the major advances that have been made, some research directions, and future challenges are presented. {\textcopyright} 2007-2012 IEEE.},

This article provides a structured overview of different continuum-mechanical models that have been developed over the years. It aims at facilitating model choice for specific soft tissue modelling applications. According to the complexity of the model, different features of soft biological tissue will be incorporated, i.e. nonlinearity, viscoelasticity, anisotropy, heterogeneity and finally, tissue damage during deformation. A brief summary of experimental methods for material characterisation and an introduction to methods for geometric modelling are also provided. The overview is non-exhaustive, focusing on the most important general models and models with specific biological applications. A trade-off in complexity must be made for enabling real-time simulation, but still maintaining realistic representation of the organ deformation. Depending on the organ and tissue types, different models with emphasis on certain features will prove to be more appropriate, meaning the optimal model choice is organ and tissue-dependent. {\textcopyright} 2009 Informa plc.},

Each of the powered joints has a series elastic actuator, which can deliver 100 Nm torque and 1 kW power. A finite-state machine based controller provides gait assistance in both the sagittal and frontal planes. State transitions, such as stepping, can be triggered by the displacement of the Center of Mass (CoM). A novel step-width adaptation algorithm was proposed to stabilize lateral balance. We tested this exoskeleton on both healthy subjects and paraplegics. Experimental results showed that all users could successfully trigger steps by CoM displacement. The step-width adaptation algorithm could actively counteract disturbances, such as pushes. With the current implementations, stable walking without crutches has been achieved for healthy subjects but not yet for SCI paraplegics.

In this context we propose a combination of lightweight, intrinsically compliant, high-torque actuators (pleated pneumatic artificial muscles) with safe and adaptable guidance along a target trajectory by means of proxy-based sliding mode control. We developed a powered knee exoskeleton (KNEXO) to evaluate these concepts. In addition to the trajectory-based controller a torque controller was implemented with a view to minimizing the interaction during unassisted walking. First, various treadmill walking experiments were performed with unimpaired subjects wearing KNEXO to evaluate the performance of the proposed controllers. Test results confirm the ability of KNEXO to display low actuator torques in unassisted mode and to provide safe, adaptable guidance in assisted mode. Subsequently, a multiple sclerosis patient participated in a series of pilot experiments. Provided there was some patient-specific controller tuning KNEXO was found to effectively support and compliantly guide the subject's knee.

The arm dynamics of the human are modeled as a mechanical impedance that follows a latent desired trajectory. We adopt a Bayesian perspective setting Gaussian Process (GP) priors on impedance parameters and the desired trajectory, which allows regression about human behavior from observed trajectories and interaction forces.

It provides practical means of measuring pressure and shear stresses simultaneously. In particular, it comprises of a flexible frame (20. mm. ×. 20. mm), with thickness of 4. mm. By employing rapid prototyping technology in its fabrication, it offers a low-cost and versatile solution, with capability of adopting bespoke shapes of lower-limb residua. The sensor was first analysed using finite element analysis (FEA) and then evaluated using lab-based electromechanical tests. The results validate that the sensor is capable of monitoring both pressure and shear at stresses up to 350. kPa and 80. kPa, respectively. A post-signal processing model is developed to induce pressure and shear stresses, respectively. The effective separation of pressure and shear signals can be potentially advantageous for sensor calibration in clinical applications. The sensor also demonstrates high linearity (approx. 5-8{\%}) and high pressure (approx. 1.3. kPa) and shear (approx. 0.6. kPa) stress resolution performance. Accordingly, the sensor offers the potential for exploitation as an assistive tool to both evaluate prosthetic socket fitting in clinical settings and alert amputees in home settings of excessive loading at the stump-socket interface, effectively preventing stump tissue breakdown at an early stage.},

abstract = {Goal: This paper presents an algorithm for accurately estimating pelvis, thigh, and shank kinematics during walking using only three wearable inertial sensors. Methods: The algorithm makes novel use of a constrained Kalman filter (CKF). The algorithm iterates through the prediction (kinematic equation), measurement (pelvis position pseudo-measurements, zero velocity update, flat-floor assumption, and covariance limiter), and constraint update (formulation of hinged knee joints and ball-and-socket hip joints). Results: Evaluation of the algorithm using an optical motion capture-based sensor-to-segment calibration on nine participants ({\$}7{\$} men and {\$}2{\$} women, weight {\$}63.0 \backslashpm 6.8{\$} kg, height {\$}1.70 \backslashpm 0.06{\$} m, age {\$}24.6 \backslashpm 3.9{\$} years old), with no known gait or lower body biomechanical abnormalities, who walked within a {\$}4 \backslashtimes 4{\$} m{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} capture area shows that it can track motion relative to the mid-pelvis origin with mean position and orientation (no bias) root-mean-square error (RMSE) of {\$}5.21 \backslashpm 1.3{\$} cm and {\$}16.1 \backslashpm 3.2{\^{}}\backslashcirc{\$}, respectively. The sagittal knee and hip joint angle RMSEs (no bias) were {\$}10.0 \backslashpm 2.9{\^{}}\backslashcirc{\$} and {\$}9.9 \backslashpm 3.2{\^{}}\backslashcirc{\$}, respectively, while the corresponding correlation coefficient (CC) values were {\$}0.87 \backslashpm 0.08{\$} and {\$}0.74 \backslashpm 0.12{\$}. Conclusion: The CKF-based algorithm was able to track the 3D pose of the pelvis, thigh, and shanks using only three inertial sensors worn on the pelvis and shanks. Significance: Due to the Kalman-filter-based algorithm's low computation cost and the relative convenience of using only three wearable sensors, gait parameters can be computed in real-time and remotely for long-term gait monitoring. Furthermore, the system can be used to inform real-time gait assistive devices.},

abstract = {Detailed knowledge about loading of the knee joint is essential for preclinical testing of implants, validation of musculoskeletal models and biomechanical understanding of the knee joint. The contact forces and moments acting on the tibial component were therefore measured in 5 subjects in vivo by an instrumented knee implant during various activities of daily living. Average peak resultant forces, in percent of body weight, were highest during stair descending (346{\%} BW), followed by stair ascending (316{\%} BW), level walking (261{\%} BW), one legged stance (259{\%} BW), knee bending (253{\%} BW), standing up (246{\%} BW), sitting down (225{\%} BW) and two legged stance (107{\%} BW). Peak shear forces were about 10–20 times smaller than the axial force. Resultant forces acted almost vertically on the tibial plateau even during high flexion. Highest moments acted in the frontal plane with a typical peak to peak range −2.91{\%} BWm (adduction moment) to 1.61{\%} BWm (abduction moment) throughout all activities. Peak flexion/extension moments ranged between −0.44{\%} BWm (extension moment) and 3.16{\%} BWm (flexion moment). Peak external/internal torques lay between −1.1{\%} BWm (internal torque) and 0.53{\%} BWm (external torque). The knee joint is highly loaded during daily life. In general, resultant contact forces during dynamic activities were lower than the ones predicted by many mathematical models, but lay in a similar range as measured in vivo by others. Some of the observed load components were much higher than those currently applied when testing knee implants.},

abstract = {Since manual rehabilitation therapy can be taxing for both the patient and the physiotherapist, a gait rehabilitation robot has been built to reduce the physical strain and increase the efficacy of the rehabilitation therapy. The prototype of the gait rehabilitation robot is designed to provide assistance while walking for patients with abnormal gait pattern and it can also be used for rehabilitation therapy to restore an individual's normal gait pattern by aiding motor recovery. The Gait Rehabilitation Robot uses gait event based synchronization, which enables the exoskeleton to provide synchronous assistance during walking that aims to reduce the lower-limb muscle activation. This study emphasizes on the biomechanical effects of assisted walking on the lower limb by analyzing the EMG signal, knee joint kinematics data that was collected from the right leg during the various experimental conditions. The analysis of the measured data shows an improved knee joint trajectory and reduction in muscle activity with assistance. The result of this study does not only assess the functionality of the exoskeleton but also provides a profound understanding of the human-robot interaction by studying the effects of assistance on the lower limb.},

abstract = {Human joint dynamic stiffness plays an important role in the stability of performance augmentation exoskeletons. In this paper, we consider a new frequency domain model of the human joint dynamics which features a complex value stiffness. This complex stiffness consists of a real stiffness and a hysteretic damping. We use it to explain the dynamic behaviors of the human connected to the exoskeleton, in particular the observed non-zero low frequency phase shift and the near constant damping ratio of the resonance as stiffness and inertia vary. We validate this concept with an elbow-joint exoskeleton testbed (attached to a subject) by experimentally varying joint stiffness behavior, exoskeleton inertia, and the strength augmentation gain. We compare three different models of elbow-joint dynamic stiffness: A model with real stiffness, viscous damping and inertia; a model with complex stiffness and inertia; and a model combining the previous two models. Our results show that the hysteretic damping term improves modeling accuracy (via a statistical F-test). Moreover, this term contributes more to model accuracy than the viscous damping term. In addition, we experimentally observe a linear relationship between the hysteretic damping and the real part of the stiffness which allows us to simplify the complex stiffness model down to a 1-parameter system. Ultimately, we design a fractional order controller to demonstrate how human hysteretic damping behavior can be exploited to improve strength amplification performance while maintaining stability.},

The former phenomenon pertains to the coordinates used to parameterize the configuration manifold of the system, while the latter phenomenon has a distinctive physical manifestation. In the present paper, we use tools from differential geometry to show how gimbal lock is intimately associated with an orthogonality condition on the applied forces and moments which act on the system. This condition is equivalent to a generalized applied force being normal to the configuration manifold of the system. Numerous examples, including the classic bead on a rotating hoop example and a gimbaled rigid body, are used to illuminate the orthogonality condition. These examples help to offer a new explanation for the elimination of gimbal lock by the addition of gimbals and demonstrate how integrable constraints alter the configuration manifold and may consequently eliminate coordinate singularities.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel control method to minimize muscle energy for power-assistant robotic systems that support the intended motions of a user under unknown external perturbations, using surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals. Conventional control methods based on force/torque (F/T) sensors have limitations to detect human intentions and could, presumably, misunderstand or distort such intentions because of external perturbations of the interaction forces, such as those found in activities of daily living. F/T sensors measure the sum of the applied force, including unknown external forces and human intention; thus, a power-assistant robot controller cannot exactly decompose the real human force. In this paper, we describe a counterexample that cannot be supported by conventional force-sensor-based control methods. We also verify why these control methods may guide human behavior in the wrong direction, and thus, have limitations under unknown external perturbations. We then propose a new control method to minimize the muscle energy indicated by sEMG signals. The proposed control approach is fundamentally based on the concept of power-assistance, in which a robot can reduce the users expended muscle energy while performing given tasks. The proposed control approach is verified through experiments using a power-assistant robotic system for the upper limbs under external perturbations.},

The dimension of each segment is determined by hand anthropometric data obtained from measurements. Each finger is controlled by one motor to allow for independent movement of each finger, which is fundamental for hand dexterity. The design was guided by a proposed mechanical model (the exo-finger model) which was verified by simulation and validated by the movement recorded by prototype fingers.

abstract = {Sideways falls onto the hip are responsible for a great number of fractures in older adults. One of the possible ways to prevent these fractures is through early identification of people at greatest risk so that preventive measures can be properly implemented. Many numerical techniques that are designed to predict the femur fracture risk are validated through performing quasi-static (QS) mechanical tests on isolated cadaveric femurs, whereas the real hip fracture is a result of an impact (IM) incident. The goal of this study was to compare the fracture limits of the proximal femur under IM and QS conditions in the simulation of a sideways fall to identify any possible relationship between them. Eight pairs of fresh frozen cadaveric femurs were divided into two groups of QS and IM (left and right randomized). All femurs were scanned with a Hologic DXA scanner and then cut and potted in a cylindrical tube. To measure the stiffness in two conditions of the single-leg stance (SLS) and sideways fall (SWF), non-destructive tests at a QS displacement rate were performed on the two groups. For the destructive tests, the QS group was tested in SWF configuration with the rate of 0.017 mm/s using a material testing machine, and the IM group was tested in the same configuration inside a pneumatic IM device with the projectile target displacement rate of 3 m/s. One of the IM specimens was excluded due to multiple strikes. The result of this study showed that there were no significant differences in the SLS and SWF stiffnesses between the two groups (P = 0.15 and P = 0.64, respectively). The destructive test results indicated that there was a significant difference in the fracture loads of the two groups (P {\textless} 0.00001) with the impact ones being higher; however, they were moderately correlated (R2 = 0.45). Also, the comparison of the fracture location showed a qualitatively good agreement between the two groups. Using the relationship developed herein, results from another study were extrapolated with errors of less than 12{\%}, showing that meaningful predictions for the impact scenario can be made based on the quasi-static tests. The result of this study suggests that there is a potential to replace IM tests with QS displacement rate tests, and this will provide important information that can be used for future studies evaluating clinical factors related to fracture risk.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The metabolic cost of walking increases when mass is added to the legs, but the effects of load magnitude and location on the energetics and biomechanics of walking are unclear. We hypothesized that with leg loading 1) net metabolic rate would be related to the moment of inertia of the leg (I(leg)), 2) kinematics would be conserved, except for heavy foot loads, and 3) swing-phase sagittal-plane net muscle moments and swing-phase leg-muscle electromyography (EMG) would increase. METHODS: Five adult males walked on a force-measuring treadmill at 1.25 m.s(-1) with no load and with loads of 2 and 4 kg per foot and shank, 4 and 8 kg per thigh, and 4, 8, and 16 kg on the waist. We recorded metabolic rate and sagittal-plane kinematics and net muscle moments about the hip, knee, and ankle during the single-stance and swing phases, and EMG of key leg muscles. RESULTS: Net metabolic rate during walking increased with load mass and more distal location and was correlated with I(leg) (r2 = 0.43). Thigh loading was relatively inexpensive, helping to explain why the metabolic rate during walking is not strongly affected by body mass distribution. Kinematics, single-stance and swing-phase muscle moments, and EMG were similar while walking with no load or with waist, thigh, or shank loads. The increase in net metabolic rate with foot loading was associated with greater EMG of muscles that initiate leg swing and greater swing-phase muscle moments. CONCLUSIONS: Distal leg loads increase the metabolic rate required for swinging the leg. The increase in metabolic rate with more proximal loads may be attributable to a combination of supporting (via hip abduction muscles) and propagating the swing leg.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Objective: To explore the relation between serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and bone mineral density (BMD), adjusted for lifestyle factors including smoking. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: The Troms{\o} Study is a population-based study performed for the fifth time in 2001. Serum PTH was measured and the subjects filled in a questionnaire covering lifestyle factors. BMD at the hip, distal and ultradistal forearm was measured. Results: Complete datasets were available in 1442 men and 1368 women. Age, body mass index and serum PTH were strong predictors of BMD level at the hip in both genders. No significant relation was seen between serum PTH and BMD at the distal or ultradistal forearm. When smokers and non-smokers were analysed separately, the relation between PTH and BMD at the hip was significant in current non-smokers only. In males, current non-smokers had significantly higher BMD at all three measurement sites compared with current smokers. Male former smokers had values in between current and never smokers. There was a significant and negative relation between number of years smoked and BMD at the hip. In male former smokers, there was an increase in BMD with increasing years since smoking cessation. Conclusion: Serum PTH is negatively associated with BMD at the hip, and the relation seems to be masked, or diminished, by smoking. Smoking reduces BMD at the hip, distal and ultradistal forearm in males, and the effect appears to be mainly time and not dose dependent. {\textcopyright} 2008 Society of the European Journal of Endocrinology.},

abstract = {Rehabilitation robotics has received more and more attention during the last decades, especially the exoskeleton device for the upper limb rehabilitation, but most of them are heavy and large. In our study, a light and wearable exoskeleton device was proposed, which can be used in home rehabilitation and it can also be used to implement passive and active training. In this paper, we proposed to perform the active rehabilitation based on the upper limb exoskeleton rehabilitation device (ULERD) with variable stiffness elastic actuators, which improves the safety for human-robot interaction and produces adjustable stiffness capacity and resistance training to meet the demand for safe active-passive elbow rehabilitation. It provides a wide approach for human machine interface (HMI) in which the device is non-backdrivable, and at the same time it is difficult to obtain the contact force information directly. The proposed method was verified by the experiments conducted under two conditions with passive DoFs unlocked and with passive DoFs locked during elbow flexion and extension performance. Each experiment has three level resistances provided to the user. The surface electromyography (sEMG) signals derived from biceps and triceps were used to evaluate the efficacy of this method in both experiments.},

abstract = {This work presents and discusses a general approach for the dynamic modeling and analysis of a passive biped walking robot, with a particular focus on the feet-ground contact interaction. The main purpose of this investigation is to address the supporting foot slippage and viscoelastic dissipative contact forces of the biped robot-walking model and to develop its dynamics equations for simple and double support phases. For this investigation, special attention has been given to the detection of the contact/impact between the legs of the biped and the ground. The results have been obtained with multibody system dynamics applying forward dynamics. This study aims at examining and comparing several force models dealing with different approaches in the context of multibody system dynamics. The normal contact forces developed during the dynamic walking of the robot are evaluated using several models: Hertz, Kelvin-Voight, Hunt and Crossley, Lankarani and Nikravesh, and Flores. Thanks to this comparison, it was shown that the normal force that works best for this model is the dissipative Nonlinear Flores Contact Force Model (hysteresis damping parameter - energy dissipation). Likewise, the friction contact/impact problem is solved using the Bengisu equations. The numerical results reveal that the stable periodic solutions are robust. Integrators and resolution methods are also purchased, in order to obtain the most efficient ones for this model.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel calibration procedure as a simple, yet powerful, method to place and align inertial sensors with body segments. The calibration can be easily replicated without the need of any additional tools. The proposed method is validated in three different applications: a computer mathematical simulation; a simplified joint composed of two semi-spheres interconnected by a universal goniometer; and a real gait test with five able-bodied subjects. Simulation results demonstrate that, after the calibration method is applied, the joint angles are correctly measured independently of previous sensor placement on the joint, thus validating the proposed procedure. In the cases of a simplified joint and a real gait test with human volunteers, the method also performs correctly, although secondary plane errors appear when compared with the simulation results. We believe that such errors are caused by limitations of the current inertial measurement unit (IMU) technology and fusion algorithms. In conclusion, the presented calibration procedure is an interesting option to solve the alignment problem when using IMUs for gait analysis.},

The design was inspired by previous simulation work, where the results highly supported benefits of the push–pull strategy on reducing the back muscular efforts and bending moment for the sagittal spine flexion/extension. A passive physical prototype was designed and constructed to test the push–pull strategy on human subjects. Three subjects were able to repeat the identical dynamic spine flexion and extension tasks with the spine exoskeleton prototype. The surface electromyography showed a reduction of up to 24{\%} at lumbar and 54{\%} at thoracic level muscle for the human subjects wearing the exoskeleton suit to accomplish the same static tasks without any external assistance. The muscle force and intervertebral bending moment were estimated to be reduced by up to 479 N and 36 N {\textperiodcentered} m, respectively.},

@article{Zanotto2015b,
abstract = {Due to the complexity of the human musculoskeletal system and intra/intersubjects variability, powered exoskeletons are prone to human-robot misalignments. These induce undesired interaction forces that may jeopardize safe operation. Uncompensated inertia of the robotic links also generates spurious interaction forces. Current design approaches to compensate for misalignments rely on the use of auxiliary passive degrees of freedom that unavoidably increase robot inertia, which potentially affects their effectiveness in reducing undesired interaction forces. Assessing the relative impact of misalignment and robot inertia on the wearer can, therefore, provide useful insights on how to improve the effectiveness of such approaches, especially in those situations where the dynamics of the movement are quasi-periodic and, therefore, predictable such as in gait. In this paper, we studied the effects of knee joint misalignments on the wearer's gait, by using a treadmill-based exoskeleton developed by our group, the ALEX II. Knee joint misalignments were purposely introduced by adjusting the mismatch between the length of the robot thigh and that of the human thigh. The amount of robot inertia reflected to the user was adjusted through control. Results evidenced that knee misalignment significantly changes human-robot interaction forces, especially at the thigh interface, and this effect can be attenuated by actively compensating for robot inertia. Misalignments caused by an excessively long robot thigh are less critical than misalignments of equal magnitude deriving from an excessively short robot thigh.},

Muscle suit is a wear without a metal frame and it uses a McKibben actuator driven by compressed air. Because actuators are sewn into the garment, no metal frame is needed, making the muscle suit very light and cost-efficient. Most medical and welfare apparatuses were developed for caregivers rather than patients in need of nursing, causing patients to lose their own identity and a positive attitude. With muscle suit, patients could control their movement on their own will. Muscle suits are very helpful for both muscular and mental support.},

abstract = {A sensory apparatus to monitor pressure distribution on the physical human-robot interface of lower-limb exoskeletons is presented. We propose a distributed measure of the interaction pressure over the whole contact area between the user and the machine as an alternative measurement method of human-robot interaction. To obtain this measure, an array of newly-developed soft silicone pressure sensors is inserted between the limb and the mechanical interface that connects the robot to the user, in direct contact with the wearer's skin. Compared to state-of-the-art measures, the advantage of this approach is that it allows for a distributed measure of the interaction pressure, which could be useful for the assessment of safety and comfort of human-robot interaction. This paper presents the new sensor and its characterization, and the development of an interaction measurement apparatus, which is applied to a lower-limb rehabilitation robot. The system is calibrated, and an example its use during a prototypical gait training task is presented.},

abstract = {Gait analysis has demonstrated to efficaciously support clinical investigations. The patterns of the outcome variables (joint angles, moments and powers) are characterized by an intrinsic and extrinsic variability. Particularly, extrinsic variability is induced by operator-dependent differences in markers' placement, with errors propagating non-linearly to alter outcome variable patterns. The aims of this study are (1) to consider a specific gait analysis protocol named LAMB and provide a description of its procedures, (2) to experimentally assess the between-operator and within-operator variability induced by operator-dependent marking of required anatomical landmarks and (3) to evidence how such inaccuracies propagates to the gait analysis kinematic and kinetic outcome variables. Six expert gait analysis operators performed LAMB anatomical landmarks marking on three healthy adult participants; moreover, one operator repeated three times the marking on one participant. The participants then performed a set of locomotor tasks including stair negotiation and heel- and toe-walking. An anatomical calibration approach let to register each marking and to compute, starting from one single raw data set, a set of outcome variables for each marking/operator. The between-operator variability of gait analysis outcome was assessed in terms of mean absolute variability to quantify offsets and minimal correlation coefficient to quantify patterns' similarity. The results evidence average minimal correlation coefficient ranging from 0.857 for moments to 0.907 for angles and average mean absolute variability accounted for few degrees in angular variables (worst between-operator mean absolute variability is 7.3°), while dynamic variables mean absolute variability, relative to the variable range, was below 5{\%} for moment and below 10{\%} for powers. The variability indexes are comparable to those related to previously published protocols and are independent from the considered task, thus suggesting that the LAMB is a reliable protocol suitable for the analysis of different locomotor tasks.},

It provides a human with assistive forces controlled by the human intention. Since it applies geared DC motors, however, the control efforts are used mainly to overcome the resistive forces caused by the friction, the damping and the inertia in the actuator. In this paper, such undesired properties are rejected by applying a flexible transmission. With the proposed method, it is intended that an actuator exhibits zero impedance without friction and generates the desired torques precisely. Since the actuation system of SUBAR has a large model variation due to human-robot interaction, a control algorithm for the flexible transmission is designed based on robust control theory. In this paper, the mechanical design of SUBAR including the flexible transmission and its associated control algorithm are discussed. They are also verified by experiments.},

abstract = {(from the chapter) To provide an overview of the sociology of urban health, this chapter will briefly look at the history of the field and the role racial issues played in giving rise to our current focus on neighborhood effects. Then we will discuss the difficulties of doing empirical research on the social and physical environments that affect the health of individuals. It is not easy to distinguish the effects of areas from the attributes of the people who live there. Does a disadvantaged family carry the same burden regardless of location, or does it face additional hurdles if it resides in a disadvantaged community? And how does one measure community disadvantage? The role of particular statistical techniques, mixed or multi-level models, in resolving the neighborhood-effects conundrum will be reviewed. And the importance of researchers knowing how to draw the relevant boundaries of communities, and how to specify the causal pathways between neighborhood characteristics and individuals' health, will be explored in some detail. We will see how the field's most fruitful concept, the notion of "social capital" as the resources provided by networks and mutual trust, is used to explain the ties that buffer individuals from harm. In conclusion, we can see that the foundations for the sociology of urban health are well established, but we have some distance to go before our stock of analytical tools and empirical findings rivals those of allied sciences.

abstract = {With efficiencies derived from evolution, growth and learning, humans are very well-tuned for locomotion 1 . Metabolic energy used during walking can be partly replaced by power input from an exoskeleton 2 , but is it possible to reduce metabolic rate without providing an addi-tional energy source? This would require an improvement in the efficiency of the human–machine system as a whole, and would be remarkable given the apparent optimality of human gait. Here we show that the metabolic rate of human walking can be reduced by an unpowered ankle exoskeleton. We built a lightweight elastic device that acts in parallel with the user's calf muscles, off-loading muscle force and thereby reducing the metabolic energy consumed in con-tractions. The device uses a mechanical clutch to hold a spring as it is stretched and relaxed by ankle movements when the foot is on the ground, helping to fulfil one function of the calf muscles and Achilles tendon. Unlike muscles, however, the clutch sustains force passively. The exoskeleton consumes no chemical or electrical energy and deli-vers no net positive mechanical work, yet reduces the metabolic cost of walking by 7.2 6 2.6{\%} for healthy human users under natural conditions, comparable to savings with powered devices. Improving upon walking economy in this way is analogous to altering the struc-ture of the body such that it is more energy-effective at walking. While strong natural pressures have already shaped human locomotion, improvements in efficiency are still possible. Much remains to be learned about this seemingly simple behaviour. Humans are skilled walkers. Over generations, our bodies have evolved muscular 1 , skeletal 3 and neural 4 systems well-suited to locomotion. We learn and embed walking coordination strategies over our lifetimes 5 and adapt to new locomotor environments in minutes or seconds 6 . We take about 10,000 steps per day 7 , or hundreds of millions of steps in a lifetime, exceeding the approximately 10,000 h of practice thought to be needed to attain expertise 8 by adulthood. We naturally keep energy expenditure low during walking, choosing, for example, step length 9},

abstract = {Wearable motion tracking systems have gained large popularity in the last decades because of their effectiveness in many fields, from performance assessment to human-robot interaction. Among all the approaches, those based on inertial sensors have been widely explored. Since inertial sensors are affected by measurements drift, they need to be aided by other sensors, thus requiring sensor measurements to be fused. The most used sensor fusion techniques are based on Kalman filter. In particular, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) are used because of the non linearity characterizing most of the models. They often aim at reconstructing human motion by estimating limbs orientation, involving human's kinematics to constrain relative motion of the limbs. These models often neglect part of the degrees of freedom (DoFs) that characterize human upper limbs, especially when modeling humerus motion with respect to the chest. In this paper we present a novel 7 DoFs model which represents a trade-off between modeling accuracy and complexity for the human upper limb. In particular, we model the human shoulder girdle taking into account also the humerus head's elevation and the retraction due to the scapula's and the clavicle's motions. The model exploits inertial sensors measurements by means of an Unscented Kalman filter to reconstruct human movements. The system performance is validated firstly against a reconstruction based on an optical tracking system. Secondly, the 5 DoFs model extracted form the 7 DoFs one was checked to have state of the art performance and used to estimate the improvement of position estimation that are obtained by extending the model to 7 DoFs.},

abstract = {Wearable assistive devices have demonstrated the potential to improve mobility outcomes for individuals with disabilities, and to augment healthy human performance; however, these benefits depend on how effectively power is transmitted from the device to the human user. Quantifying and understanding this power transmission is challenging due to complex human-device interface dynamics that occur as biological tissues and physical interface materials deform and displace under load, absorbing and returning power. Here we introduce a new methodology for quickly estimating interface power dynamics during movement tasks using common motion capture and force measurements, and then apply this method to quantify how a soft robotic ankle exosuit interacts with and transfers power to the human body during walking. We partition exosuit end-effector power (i.e., power output from the device) into power that augments ankle plantarflexion (termed augmentation power) vs. power that goes into deformation and motion of interface materials and underlying soft tissues (termed interface power). We provide empirical evidence of how human-exosuit interfaces absorb and return energy, reshaping exosuit-to-human power flow and resulting in three key consequences: (i) During exosuit loading (as applied forces increased), about 55{\%} of exosuit end-effector power was absorbed into the interfaces. (ii) However, during subsequent exosuit unloading (as applied forces decreased) most of the absorbed interface power was returned viscoelastically. Consequently, the majority (about 75{\%}) of exosuit end-effector work over each stride contributed to augmenting ankle plantarflexion. (iii) Ankle augmentation power (and work) was delayed relative to exosuit end-effector power, due to these interface energy absorption and return dynamics. Our findings elucidate the complexities of human-exosuit interface dynamics during transmission of power from assistive devices to the human body, and provide insight into improving the design and control of wearable robots. We conclude that in order to optimize the performance of wearable assistive devices it is important, throughout design and evaluation phases, to account for human-device interface dynamics that affect power transmission and thus human augmentation benefits.},

However, a fundamental revision of that Directive is needed to establish a robust, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework for in vitro diagnostic medical devices which ensures a high level of safety and health whilst supporting innovation. (2) This Regulation aims to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market as regards in vitro diagnostic medical devices, taking as a base a high level of protection of health for patients and users, and taking into account the small and medium-sized enterprises that are active in this sector. At the same time, this Regulation sets high standards of quality and safety for in vitro diagnostic medical devices in order to meet common safety concerns as regards such products. Both objectives are being pursued simultaneously and are inseparably linked whilst one not being secondary to the other. As regards Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), this Regulation harmonises the rules for the placing on the market and putting into service of in vitro diagnostic medical devices and their accessories on the Union market thus allowing them to benefit from the principle of free movement of goods. As regards Article 168(4)(c) TFEU, this Regulation sets high standards of quality and safety for in vitro diagnostic medical devices by ensuring, among other things, that data generated in performance studies are reliable and robust and that the safety of subjects participating in performance studies is protected. (3) This Regulation does not seek to harmonise rules relating to the further making available on the market of in vitro diagnostic medical devices after they have already been put into service, such as in the context of secondhand sales. (4) Key elements of the existing regulatory approach, such as the supervision of notified bodies, risk classification, conformity assessment procedures, performance evaluation and performance studies, vigilance and market surveillance should be significantly reinforced, whilst provisions ensuring transparency and traceability regarding in vitro diagnostic medical devices should be introduced, to improve health and safety. (5) To the extent possible, guidance developed for in vitro diagnostic medical devices},

abstract = {Modeling joint contact in OpenSim is not well understood. This study systematically investigated the variables associated with the elastic foundation contact model within OpenSim by performing a series of controlled benchtop experiment and concomitant simulations. Four metal-on-plastic interactions were modeled, including a model of a total knee replacement (TKR). Load-displacement curves were recorded during cyclic loading between 100 and 750 N. Geometries were imported and into OpenSim and contact mechanics were modeled with the on-board elastic foundation algorithm. A hybrid optimization algorithm determined that stiffness and dissipation coefficients for TKR implants were 1.52 × 10 10 N/m and 57.7 Ns/m, respectively. Estimations of contact forces were 10.2{\%} of blinded experimental data (average root mean square error: 76.82 ± 11.47 N). In the second portion of this study, freely available eTibia TKR renderings were used to test the ubiquity of the tuning parameters. They were also used to perform a sensitivity analysis of material stiffness and mesh density with regard to penetration depth and computational time. When a stiffness of 1 × 10 10 was applied to an eTibia model with 5000 faces, a 100 kg load caused 0.259 mm of penetration. Under the same conditions, the tuned model experienced 0.300 mm of penetration. Material stiffnesses between 1 × 10 13 and 1 × 10 15 N/m increased computation time by factors of 12–23. This study provides much needed clarity regarding the use of the OpenSim EF algorithm. It also demonstrates the utility of OpenSim to model deformable materials and complex geometries, and this approach can be adapted to make reasonable estimations for both natural and surgically modified joints.},

abstract = {A three-dimensional model of the human body is used to simulate a maximal vertical jump. The body is modeled as a 10-segment, 23 degree-of-freedom (dof), mechanical linkage, actuated by 54 muscles. Six generalized coordinates describe the position and orientation of the pelvis relative to the ground; the remaining nine segments branch in an open chain from the pelvis. The head, arms, and torso (HAT) are modeled as a single rigid body. The HAT articulates with the pelvis via a 3 dof ball-and-socket joint. Each hip is modeled as a 3 dof ball-and-socket joint, and each knee is modeled as a 1 dof hinge joint. Each foot is represented by a hindfoot and toes segment. The hindfoot articulates with the shank via a 2 dof universal joint, and the toes articulate with the hindfoot via a 1 dof hinge joint. Interaction of the feet with the ground is modeled using a series of spring-damper units placed under the sole of each foot. The path of each muscle is represented by either a series of straight lines or a combination of straight lines and space curves. Each actuator is modeled as a three-element, Hill-type muscle in series with tendon. A first-order process is assumed to model muscle excitation-contraction dynamics. Dynamic optimization theory is used to calculate the pattern of muscle excitations that produces a maximal vertical jump. Quantitative comparisons between model and experiment indicate that the model reproduces the kinematic, kinetic, and muscle-coordination patterns evident when humans jump to their maximum achievable heights. {\textcopyright} 1999 OPA (Overseas Publishers Association) N.V.},

The experimental setup is established to receive the finger data of motion and force for optimization. The approach proposed can get the quantifiable muscle parameters to study the statistical analysis of muscle motion and rehabilitation state.

abstract = {Parathyroid hormone (PTH) may be an important determinant of cortical bone remodeling in the elderly. Vitamin D status is one of the determining factors in this relationship. The aim of this study was to quantify the relationship between serum PTH, vitamin D and bone mineral density (BMD) in elderly women in Reykjavik (64° N), where daily intake of cod liver oil is common and mean calcium intake is high. In PTH correlated inversely with 25 (OH)D (r = -0.26, p{\textless}0.01). In multivariate analysis PTH correlated inversely with whole body BMD (mostly cortical bone) (R2 = 2.2{\%}, p = 0.04) but not with the lumbar spine BMD, reflecting more cancellous bone. No association was found between 25(OH)D levels and BMD at any site in univariate or multivariate analysis. Osteocalcin, a measure of bone turnover, was negatively associated with BMD and this association remained significant when corrected for PTH levels. In summary, in this fairly vitamin D replete population with high calcium intake, PTH was negatively associated with total body BMD. We infer that suppression of PTH may reduce cortical bone loss, but other factors are likely to contribute to age-related bone remodeling and osteoporosis.},

In addition, at the time the previous edition of this standard was adopted, the established method of providing information on, with, or otherwise in association with a device was by hard copy. Predominantly, this was printed copy on substrates such as paper, card, or plastic. Since the time of approval of the first edition of this standard on 18 January 1998, the MDD and AIMDD have been amended. In addition, other methods of provision of information have become freely available and widely used. The intention of this second edition is to make available guidance for manufacturers of medical devices that is appropriate regardless of the means used to disseminate that information as well as to update the requirements to reflect the changes to Directives 90/385/EEC and 93/42/EEC. BS EN 1041, Directives 90/385/EEC and 93/42/EEC refer to the versions amended in 2007. The guidance reflects the desire to take into account different methods of provision of information, and it is intended that it should, as far as possible, be suitable for future methods of provision of information.

The probe developed within the scope of this work is based on a multi-component force sensor whereby the normal and tangential forces can be measured to determine the friction coefficient. The friction coefficient of human skin against five different fabrics was assessed in two body regions and the average results were compared with the tactile perception. By comparing the answers to a questionnaire about tactile perception with the results of the friction measurements, a positive correlation was obtained especially concerning the slippery and the smoothness properties. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We examined the metabolic cost of plantar flexor muscle-tendon mechanical work during human walking. Nine healthy subjects walked at constant step frequency on a motorized treadmill at speeds corresponding to 80{\%} (1.00 m s(-1)), 100{\%} (1.25 m s(-1)), 120{\%} (1.50 m s(-1)) and 140{\%} (1.75 m s(-1)) of their preferred step length (L(*)) at 1.25 m s(-1). In each condition subjects donned robotic ankle exoskeletons on both legs. The exoskeletons were powered by artificial pneumatic muscles and controlled using soleus electromyography (i.e. proportional myoelectric control). We measured subjects' metabolic energy expenditure and exoskeleton mechanics during both unpowered and powered walking to test the hypothesis that ankle plantarflexion requires more net metabolic power (W kg(-1)) at longer step lengths for a constant step frequency (i.e. preferred at 1.25 m s(-1)). As step length increased from 0.8 L(*) to 1.4 L(*), exoskeletons delivered approximately 25{\%} more average positive mechanical power (P=0.01; +0.20+/-0.02 W kg(-1) to +0.25+/-0.02 W kg(-1), respectively). The exoskeletons reduced net metabolic power by more at longer step lengths (P=0.002; -0.21+/-0.06 W kg(-1) at 0.8 L(*) and -0.70+/-0.12 W kg(-1) at 1.4 L(*)). For every 1 J of exoskeleton positive mechanical work subjects saved 0.72 J of metabolic energy ('apparent efficiency'=1.39) at 0.8 L(*) and 2.6 J of metabolic energy ('apparent efficiency'=0.38) at 1.4 L(*). Declining ankle muscle-tendon ;apparent efficiency' suggests an increase in ankle plantar flexor muscle work relative to Achilles' tendon elastic energy recoil during walking with longer steps. However, previously stored elastic energy in Achilles' tendon still probably contributes up to 34{\%} of ankle muscle-tendon positive work even at the longest step lengths we tested. Across the range of step lengths we studied, the human ankle muscle-tendon system performed 34-40{\%} of the total lower-limb positive mechanical work but accounted for only 7-26{\%} of the net metabolic cost of walking.},

abstract = {Abstract Ankle rehabilitation robots can play an important role in improving outcomes of the rehabilitation treatment by assisting therapists and patients in number of ways. Consequently, few robot designs have been proposed by researchers which fall under either of the two categories, namely, wearable robots or platform-based robots. This paper presents a review of both kinds of ankle robots along with a brief analysis of their design, actuation and control approaches. While reviewing these designs it was observed that most of them are undesirably inspired by industrial robot designs. Taking note of the design concerns of current ankle robots, few improvements in the ankle robot designs have also been suggested. Conventional position control or force control approaches, being used in the existing ankle robots, have been reviewed. Apparently, opportunities of improvement also exist in the actuation as well as control of ankle robots. Subsequently, a discussion on most recent research in the development of novel actuators and advanced controllers based on appropriate physical and cognitive human-robot interaction has also been included in this review. Implications for Rehabilitation Ankle joint functions are restricted/impaired as a consequence of stroke or injury during sports or otherwise. Robots can help in reinstating functions faster and can also work as tool for recording rehabilitation data useful for further analysis. Evolution of ankle robots with respect to their design and control aspects has been discussed in the present paper and a novel design with futuristic control approach has been proposed.},

abstract = {The human arm has 7 degrees of freedom (DOF) while only 6 DOF are required to position the wrist and orient the palm. Thus, the inverse kinematics of an human arm has a nonunique solution. Resolving this redundancy becomes critical as the human interacts with a wearable robot and the inverse kinematics solution of these two coupled systems must be identical to guarantee an seamless integration. The redundancy of the arm can be formulated by defining the swivel angle, the rotation angle of the plane defined by the upper and lower arm around a virtual axis that connects the shoulder and wrist joints. Analyzing reaching tasks recorded with a motion capture system indicates that the swivel angle is selected such that when the elbow joint is flexed, the palm points to the head. Based on these experimental results, a new criterion is formed to resolve the human arm redundancy. This criterion was implemented into the control algorithm of an upper limb 7-DOF wearable robot. Experimental results indicate that by using the proposed redundancy resolution criterion, the error between the predicted and the actual swivel angle adopted by the motor control system is less then 5{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}{\#}x00B0;{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}.},

A simulation architecture is developed that uses the musculoskeletal models from OpenSim, and that implements an exoskeleton control algorithm and human response model in Matlab. The musculoskeletal models need to be extended with the response of a user to external forces to simulate the dynamic interaction. A set of experiments was performed to fit this response model. A validation test showed that more than 80{\%} of the variance of the motion could be explained. With the human response model in the combined simulation architecture, a simulation in which an object connects with the exoskeleton or with the human is performed. The effect of the exoskeleton on, among others, muscle excitation and altered motion can be assessed with this architecture. Our work can be used to better predict the effect an exoskeleton has on the user.},

Design/methodology/approach – This paper first describes a number of recently developed exoskeletons for military, civil and medical applications. It then discusses robotic prosthetics and concludes with a brief consideration of progress in brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. Findings – Robotic exoskeletons are the topic of a major research effort, much being funded by the US military, and aims to impart superhuman strength to the wearer. Japanese research is also well advanced and concerns a range of non-military applications, including strength enhancement and medical rehabilitation. Some products have recently been commercialised. There has also been significant progress in the development of robotic prosthetic limbs, a topic which is also attracting support from the US military. A key aim is the development of thought-controlled prosthetics which will arise from advances in BCI technology. Originality/value – This paper provides a detailed review of the latest developments in exoskeletons and robotic prosthetics.},

This has been variously attributed to initial bedding in, wear or time-dependency behaviour. Cyclic and sustained loading were used in laboratory conditions to investigate this phenomenon. The results show that the sensitivity of the sensor varies rapidly over the first minute of loading. There is also a slower long-term effect which reduces over time.

Without a payload, the exoskeleton weighs 11.7kg and requires only 2 Watts of electrical power during loaded walking. For a 36 kg payload, we demonstrate that the quasi-passive exoskeleton transfers on average 80{\%} of the load to the ground during the single support phase of walking. By measuring the rate of oxygen consumption on a study participant walking at a self-selected speed, we find that the exoskeleton slightly increases the walking metabolic cost of transport (COT) as compared to a standard loaded backpack (10{\%} increase). However, a similar exoskeleton without joint springs or damping control (zero-impedance exoskeleton) is found to increase COT by 23{\%} com- pared to the loaded backpack, highlighting the benefits of passive and quasi-passive joint mechanisms in the design of efficient, low-mass leg exoskeletons.},

abstract = {In this review, we discuss the current knowledge on the tribology of human skin and present an analysis of the available experimental results for skin friction coefficients. Starting with an overview on the factors influencing the friction behaviour of skin, we discuss the up-to-date existing experimental data and compare the results for different anatomical skin areas and friction measurement techniques. For this purpose, we also estimated and analysed skin contact pressures applied during the various friction measurements. The detailed analyses show that substantial variations are a characteristic feature of friction coefficients measured for skin and that differences in skin hydration are the main cause thereof, followed by the influences of surface and material properties of the contacting materials. When the friction coefficients of skin are plotted as a function of the contact pressure, the majority of the literature data scatter over a wide range that can be explained by the adhesion friction model. The case of dry skin is reflected by relatively low and pressure-independent friction coefficients (greater than 0.2 and typically around 0.5), comparable to the dry friction of solids with rough surfaces. In contrast, the case of moist or wet skin is characterised by significantly higher (typically {\textgreater}1) friction coefficients that increase strongly with decreasing contact pressure and are essentially determined by the mechanical shear properties of wet skin. In several studies, effects of skin deformation mechanisms contributing to the total friction are evident from friction coefficients increasing with contact pressure. However, the corresponding friction coefficients still lie within the range delimited by the adhesion friction model. Further research effort towards the analysis of the microscopic contact area and mechanical properties of the upper skin layers is needed to improve our so far limited understanding of the complex tribological behaviour of human skin. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Trajectory planning is a paramount requirement for upper limb rehabilitation robots because that can help stroke patients to receive rehabilitation training, especially in the implementation of activities of daily life. The patient-customized trajectory planning of the robot system is much more fit with human movement. This paper proposes an equivalent kinematics model of the upper limb, which covers all degrees of freedom of the upper limb. The trajectory planning based on this kinematics model is appropriate for upper limb exoskeleton rehabilitation or assistive robots. In addition, the proposed model has been experimentally validated on the prototype of an upper limb exoskeleton robot. The model of the exoskeleton is obtained by simplifying extra degrees of freedom of the kinematics model. And taking movement trajectory of the exoskeleton by cubic polynomial coincides with that by quintic polynomials, which proves that the approach can optimize the approach of trajectory planning. Furthermore, a significant reduction of trajectory generated operation can be achieved, with a consequent remarkable computational time-saving. Finally, results from taking things experiments with the exoskeleton are presented, which verify the usability of trajectory planning.},

abstract = {For partial lower-limb exoskeletons, an accurate real-time estimation of the gait phase is paramount to provide timely and well-tailored assistance during gait. To this end, dedicated wearable sensors separate from the exoskeletons mechanical structure may be preferable because they are typically isolated from movement artifacts that often result from the transient dynamics of the physical human-robot interaction. Moreover, wearable sensors that do not require time-consuming calibration procedures are more easily acceptable by users. In this study a robotic hip orthosis was controlled using capacitive sensors placed in orthopedic cuffs on the shanks. The capacitive signals are zeroed after donning the cuffs and do not require any further calibration. The capacitive sensing-based controller was designed to perform online estimation of the gait cycle phase via adaptive oscillators, and to provide a phase-locked assistive torque. Two experimental activities were carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. Experiments conducted with seven healthy subjects walking on a treadmill at different speeds demonstrated that the controller can estimate the gait phase with an average error of 4{\%}, while also providing hip flexion assistance. Moreover, experiments carried out with four healthy subjects showed that the capacitive sensing-based controller could reduce the metabolic expenditure of subjects compared to the unassisted condition (mean{\$}\backslashpm{\$}SEM, -3.2{\%}{\$}\backslashpm{\$}1.1).},

abstract = {Measurement of interaction forces distributed across the attachment interface in wearable devices is critical for understanding ergonomic physical human–robot interaction (pHRI). The main challenges in sensorization of pHRI interfaces are (i) capturing the fine nature of force transmission from compliant human tissue onto rigid surfaces in the wearable device and (ii) utilizing a low-cost and easily implementable design that can be adapted for a variety of human interfaces. This paper addresses both challenges and presents a modular sensing panel that uses force-sensing resistors (FSRs) combined with robust electrical and mechanical integration principles that result in a reliable solution for distributed load measurement. The design is demonstrated through an upper-arm cuff, which uses 24 sensing panels, in conjunction with the Harmony exoskeleton. Validation of the design with controlled loading of the sensorized cuff proves the viability of FSRs in an interface sensing solution. Preliminary experiments with a human subject highlight the value of distributed interface force measurement in recognizing the factors that influence ergonomic pHRI and elucidating their effects. The modular design and low cost of the sensing panel lend themselves to extension of this approach for studying ergonomics in a variety of wearable applications with the goal of achieving safe, comfortable, and effective human–robot interaction.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the impact of the deformable bodies on the control algorithms for physically simulated characters. We hypothesize that ignoring the effect of deformable bodies at the site of contact negatively affects the control algorithms, leading to less robust and unnatural character motions. To verify the hypothesis, we introduce a compact representation for an articulated character with deformable soft tissue and develop a practical system to simulate two-way coupling between rigid and deformable bodies in a robust and efficient manner. We then apply a few simple and widely used control algorithms, such as pose-space tracking control, Cartesian-space tracking control, and a biped controller (SIMBICON), to simulate a variety of behaviors for both full-body locomotion and hand manipulation. We conduct a series of experiments to compare our results with the motion generated by these algorithms on a character comprising only rigid bodies. The evaluation shows that the character with soft contact can withstand larger perturbations in a more noisy environment, as well as produce more realistic motion.},

abstract = {Computer models that estimate the force generation capacity of lower limb muscles have become widely used to simulate the effects of musculoskeletal surgeries and create dynamic simulations of movement. Previous lower limb models are based on severely limited data describing limb muscle architecture (i.e., muscle fiber lengths, pennation angles, and physiological cross-sectional areas). Here, we describe a new model of the lower limb based on data that quantifies the muscle architecture of 21 cadavers. The model includes geometric representations of the bones, kinematic descriptions of the joints, and Hill-type models of 44 muscle–tendon compartments. The model allows calculation of muscle–tendon lengths and moment arms over a wide range of body positions. The model also allows detailed examination of the force and moment generation capacities of muscles about the ankle, knee, and hip and is freely available at www.simtk.org.},

@article{Luger2019,
abstract = {This study investigated the effect of wearing a passive lower-limb exoskeleton on physical load, kinematics, postural control, and discomfort. 45 healthy males participated and were exposed to three 21-min simulations, including screwing, cable-mounting, and clip-fitting. Each exposure comprised one of three exoskeleton statuses (standing, high and low sitting on exoskeleton)and three working distances (optimal, far, very far). The order of exoskeleton status and working distance were randomized across subjects. A force platform was used to calculate the mean center of pressure (COP)and absolute (SSABS)and relative static postural stability (SSREL)as measures of postural control as well as the weight transferred to the exoskeleton supports as indicator of physical load. Neck and back angles were recorded together with electrical activity of four bilateral muscles (trapezius, erector, vastus, gastrocnemius). Discomfort was recorded before and after each exposure on an 11-point numeric rating scale. Physical load decreased due to the exoskeleton carrying up to 64{\%} of the subject's body mass. The COP remained within the base of support with the lowest values of static postural stability for high sitting (27{\%}). During sitting, vastus activity increased (∼95–135{\%})while gastrocnemius activity decreased (∼25{\%})compared to standing. Trapezius and erector activity levels showed only minor differences between exposures. Larger working distances resulted in a more anterior COP and increased erector activity. Standing without exoskeleton was related to less discomfort (0.5)than sitting on the exoskeleton (∼1.3). Working postures and distances changed SSREL and activity levels of the vastus, gastrocnemius, and erector, but not SSABS. However, postural stability did not approach a critical state in our simulations without external perturbations. Therefore, investigating exoskeletons in the field will provide useful information about their effectiveness and usability in dynamic working situations where external forces could occur.},

@article{Lee2014,
abstract = {In this paper, we propose a human-robot cooperation controller for the motion of the upper limb exoskeleton. The system permits three degrees of freedom using an electrical actuator that is mainly controlled by force sensor signals. These signals are used to generate the torque required to drive the exoskeleton. However, singularities exist when the force signals in the Cartesian coordinate system are transformed into torques in the joint coordinate system. Therefore, we apply the damped least squares method. When handling a load, torque compensation is required about its mass. Therefore, we installed a force sensor at the point of the robot's end-effector. It measures the forces between the exoskeleton and the load. Then, these forces are used to compensate within a static model for handling loads. We performed control stability and load handling experiments to verify the effectiveness of the controller. Via these, we confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed controller. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, selected the degrees of freedom (DOF) which actuated based on analyzed human motion, and analyzed the human joint function to design the joint modules of the exoskeletal robot. To improve the efficiency of the exoskeleton robot, a mechanical structure was designed on the basis of a semi-anthropomorphic architecture. The Hanyang EXskeleton Assistive Robot (HEXAR) has seven degrees of freedom per leg, two of which are powered by an electrical motor. Appropriately sized motors and gearing are selected, and put through a thorough power analysis. quasi-passive mechanisms were designed with compliance material for supporting the weight of external loads in the stance phase and absorbing/releasing the energy. This paper discusses design criteria considered in mechanical design for HEXAR.},

@article{Chan2004,
abstract = {The purpose of this research work was to develop a methodology to model arm movement in normal subjects and neurologically impaired individuals through the application of a statistical modelling method. Thirteen subjects with Parkinson's disease and 29 normal controls were recruited to participate in an arm motor task. An infrared optoelectronic kinematic movement analysis system was employed to record arm movement at 50 times per second. This study identified the modified extended Freundlich model as one that could be used to describe this task. Results showed that this model fit the data well and that it has a good correspondence between the observed and the predicted data. However, verification of the model showed that the residuals contained a sizeable autocorrelation factor. The Cochrane and Orcutt method was applied to remove this factor, which improved the fit of the model. Results showed that Parkinson's disease subjects had a higher autocorrelation coefficient than the normal subjects for this task. A positive correlation (rs=0.72, p{\textless}0.01) was found between the Langton-Hewer stage and the autocorrelation coefficient of PD subjects. This finding suggests that if autocorrelation is positively correlated with disease progression, clinicians in their clinical practice might use the autocorrelation value as a useful indicator to quantify the progression of a subjects' disease. Significant differences in model parameters were seen between normal and Parkinson's disease subjects. The use of such a model to represent and quantify movement patterns provides an important base for future study. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Most designs of wearable robots are based on human biomechanical statistics, engineering experience or individual experiments. Despite great successes, few of them consider the human–robot integration and individual differences between users. Additionally, the design periods, cost and safety also need to be further improved. Learning from the natural driving mechanism of human body, we propose a general human-in-the-loop (HIL) optimization designing approach for this kind of wearable robots. Firstly, the human–robot coupling model of the personalized wearable robot and the human musculoskeletal model are established. Then, the Computed Muscle Control (CMC) tool embedded in software OpenSim and the Bayesian optimization used in machine learning are combined to find the optimal design scheme for the personalized wearable robots to reduce the human metabolic energy cost in specific physical movement. The HIL approach could not only optimize the control parameters of wearable robots, but also optimize their geometry, material and any other design parameters flexibly and effectively. An application example for the HIL approach is also provided to help designers better understand and use the HIL method proposed in this paper.},
