In no particular order I would like to thank Prof. Abbas Dehghani-Sanij for his support as my principle supervisor and for the opportunity to complete this work.

I would like to thank Elaine Evens from the School of Design, Fashion department for her help with assembly of sensing sleeve and attachment cuff prototypes and final design used during this research. Thank you for the clothing design advice provided when I turned up with metres of Lycra.

I would like to thank the University of Leeds mechanical engineering technicians for their support, with specific thanks to Tony Wiese who is always there to give a helping hand when needed and Rob Cowie for guiding me through my first attempts at PCB design. 

Thank you to my parents and family for their continued support throughout my PhD I am sure you are all as glad as I am to be finished. 

The Library study group for their everlasting support, indisputable advice, intellectual lunchtime debates and late evening study sessions which made the PhD process so much more enjoyable. Most importantly the runs for the finest coffee any Library in Leeds has to offer. Fuelling concentration, facilitating a mild caffeine dependency and solving many a problem with a quick chat and a different perspective.

To my test participants who cannot be named, thank you for your time on what were some lengthy days of testing.

Thank you to my girlfriend Beril for being so supportive over the past year. I may work a little less now this is all written.

And last but not least I would like to thank my friends that have been there over the last few years. Patiently listening to ramblings and acting like they know or care about what I am talking about. I really appreciate it.
